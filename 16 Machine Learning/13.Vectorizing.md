The computer is good at doing matrix computation by using the specific hardware.

# 01 For loops vs. Vectorization

Assume that there is a group of data and parameters :

```Python
x = np.array ([200, 17])
W = np.array ([[1, -3, 5],
			  [-2, 4, -6]])
b = np.array ([-1, 1, 2])
```

If we do the computation of the activation value by for loop, it should be : 

```Python
def dense (a_in, W, b, g) :
	a_out = np.array (W.shape[1])
	for j in range (W.shape[1])
		w = W[:, j]
		z = np.dot (w, x) + b[j]
		a[j] = g (z)
	return a
```

If we do the computation by vector : 

```Python
x = np.array ([[200, 17]])
W = np.array ([[1, -3, 5],
			  [-2, 4, -6]])
b = np.array ([[-1, 1, 2]])

def dense (a_in, W, b, g) :
	Z = np.matmul (a_in, W) + b
	a_out = g (Z)
	return a_out
```

# 02 Comparison

Assume that we initialize two 1x100000 vectors. If we use `for` loop to calculate the result, we need to go on 100000 loops while vector operation only does once.

```Python
import numpy as np
import time


a = np.random.randn (1000000)
b = np.random.randn (1000000)

tic = time.time ()
c = np.dot (a, b)
toc = time.time ()
print (c)
print ("Total Time : ", 1000 * (toc - tic), " ms")

c = 0
tic = time.time ()
for i in range (1000000) :
    c += a[i] * b[i]
toc = time.time ()
print (c)
print ("Total Time : ", 1000 * (toc - tic), " ms")
```

The output is :

```Plain
298.83310749193083
Total Time :  2.113819122314453  ms
298.83310749193845
Total Time :  535.5434417724609  ms
```

We can find that the time difference is very huge.
