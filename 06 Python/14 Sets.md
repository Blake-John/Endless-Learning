In math, every collection of objects is called a **set**. You can imagine a set as a "bag" that contains its objects.

# 01 What is a set?

A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called **elements**, or **members** of the set. A convenient way of specifying a set is by listing its members within braces (curly brackets) :

$\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0\} is the set of decimal digits$
$\{Jupiter,Saturn,Uranus,Neptune\} is the set of giant planets of the Solar System$

A usual practice is to denote sets by capital Latin letters. For example, you may use $D$ and $G$ for the sets above (the set of digits and the set of giant planets, respectively).

It is also possible to characterize all the elements in a set by stating the **property or properties they must have** to be members of this set. The general form of this notation is the following :

$\{x | x\ has property P\}$ or $\{x | P(x)\}$ 

# 02 The cardinality of a set

As you already know, objects in a set are called **members** or **elements** of a set. For example, 2 is an element of the set $\{1,2,3\}$, football is an element of the set $\{tennis, football, hockey\}$ . Naturally, a set **contains** its elements. The symbol **∈** shows that an element belongs to the given set, and $\notin$ shows that the element doesn't belong to the set. For example,JavaScript $\notin$ {Python, C++, R}. If a set $S$ contains exactly $n$ elements, where $n$ is a non-negative integer, we say that $S$ is a **finite set** and that $n$ is the **cardinality** of $S$. The cardinality of $S$ is denoted by $|S|$ : for instance, the cardinality of the set {−1,1}{−1,1} is equal to 2.

A set is said to be **infinite** if it is not finite. For example, the set of integers is infinite.
