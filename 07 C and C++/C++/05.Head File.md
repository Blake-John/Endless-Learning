# What is Head File?
- **head file** is used to **declare** some functions
- so that the compiler can know the function **exists**
# Why we need Head File?
- if we **define a function in one file** and we want to **use it in another file**, we should let the compiler know the function
- we can **declare** the function in head file, and then we can **include the head file** in another file where we want to use the function
- it is said that we need a **public place to store the declarations**
- and the head file **just contain the declaration**, ==No Definition ! ==
	- it is because a function just **can be defined one time**
- head file can **avoid to write a declaration for each function**
	- it is more convinient to use head file instead of declare every function in every file if we are writing a big project, because a big project is made up of many many files and the files will repeat using the several same functions
# The Structure of the Head File
## `#pragma once`

- which can tell the compiler **only to include the head file once**
- if we have some files include **the same head file**, it will lead to an error a-> **redifinition**
- because we can only define a structure once. there are some files include the same head file, and **the way include work is to copy the head file** to the file includes it, so it will lead to **multiple definition**
```Cpp
<#pragma once>
#pragma once

void InitLog ();
void Log (const char* message);

```
## `#ifndef-#endif`

- we can use this sentence to check whether the definition is existing, and make the definition to be what we like
```Cpp
<#ifndef _LOG_H>
<#define _LOG_H>
<codes>
<#endif>

#ifndef _LOG_H
#define _LOG_H
void InitLog ();
void Log (const char* message);

struct Player {};

#endif
```

# Different Type of Include Sentence
- `#include <iostream>`
	- `<>`
	- this type is to tell the compiler to search the head file in the `include_path`
- `#include "log.h"`
	- `""`
	- this type is to tell the compiler to search the file **relative to the current file**

# Different Type of Head File
- `<studio.h>`
	- this is a `C` standard lib
- `<iostream>`
	- this is a `C++` standard lib
```ad-tip
> it is used to tell the `C standard lib` apart from `C++ standard lib`
```
