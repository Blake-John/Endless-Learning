# Characters

characters is a set of many symbols.

There is a type of data named `char` in C++, which can store a characters. But the characters not just be 1 byte, so there will be many encoding methods like UTF-8, UTF-16.

But in English, a characters is a `char` data type.

# What is a string ?

a string is essentially a group of characters, such as letters, numbers, symbols which are basically text.

It is a way for us to represent and manipulate text.

In fact, a string is **an array of characters** . So, the `string` is composed of some `char` datas, or more exactly, it is the **array of `char` data** .

# How does it work ?

## Define a string

To define a string, we can use the following code : 

```Cpp
const char* <variable_name> = <string>;

const char* name = "Cherno";

// also, we can use this to define a string
char* name2 = "Cherno";
```

- But we do not want to change the string as the string **should not be extended**, and it should have a constant memory size. So we usually to have the `const` to restrict it.

```Cpp
const char* name = "Cherno";
// name[2] = 'a';
// which will lead to an error
```

## In the memory

This is what the `name` in the memory like.

The characters is transformed into **the hexadecimal**.

And you can find that there is a byte that is set to 0, which is called **the Null Termination Character** . The null termination character tells where the string comes to an end.

### Why we need `Null Termination Character` ?

- It is because what we define the character is just a **pointer** , but how can we know the **size** of the string ?
- So there will be a symbol tells the compiler where is the end.

```ad-note
A string is begin with that **pointer** , that **memory address**, and it will **continue on** untill it hit **0** , the **Null Termination Character** .
```

### To write the `Null Termination Character` 

What if we write the null termination character myself or have no the null termination character ?

```Cpp
char name2[6] = {'C', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'n', 'o'};
```

The outpu will be : 

```Cpp
Cherno烫烫烫烫烫烫烫烫烫烫烫烫烫烫烫?[B?
```

There will be many random characters. And we can check them in the memory :

![](./imgs/14.StringImgs/Pasted%20image%2020231220133423.png)

`cc` tells us that memory is **outside range**. So we can easily know why we will get the random character -> it is because the compiler do not konw **where is the end of the array because of the lack of null termination character** . In this case, the compiler will keep outputting something from the memory untill a `\0` .

To solve the problem, we can add an `null termination character` :

```Cpp
char name[] = {'C', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'n', 'o', 0};
// or
char name[] = {'C', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'n', 'o', '\0'};
```

```ad-tip
The `null termination character` can be represented as `'\0'` , or you can just write a number `0` , which is because in the `ASCII Code` the `null termination character` has the coding number in decimal `0`.

And the type `char` will automatically change the number into a character.
```

```ad-attention
If we write `"Cherno"` , it has a type of `const char[]` or `char*` . It is different from `{'C', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'n', 'o'}` , which have a type of `char[]`.
```

# Special type `string`

In C++, there is a library named `string`, which provide a wide range of function to define and deal with the string.

```Cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

int main ()
{
	std::string name = "Cherno";
	std::cout << name << std::endl;
}
```

If we move our mouse to hover on the `"Cherno"` , we can find that the IDE tells us the string is still a `const char[]` data type.

So it tells us the string receive the type of `const char[]` .

```ad-tip
In the C++ standard under c++17, although the head file `iostream` has a definition of the type `string` , **we can't push it to the ostream `std::cout << name << std::endl;`** , it is because **the operator `<<` hasn't been overloaded** in `iostream` , so we need to include another head file `string`.

But in c++17, it is fixed.
```

# Dealing with string

- add the string behind one string

```Cpp
#include <string>

std::string name = "Cherno";
name += " Hello";
// the operator += is overloaded in <string>
```

- find character in string

```Cpp
name.find ("no");
// it will return the position of "no"
```

- act as a parameter

```Cpp
void printString (std::string a)
{
	std::cout << a;
}

```

- transform into `const char*` 

```C++
std::string str = "Cherno";
const char* c_str = str.c_str ();
```

But if we don't need to change the string in the function, it's better to do `std::string& str` .

It is because if we do the thing above, it will copy the whole string and create a new variable in the stack to store the information. It is really **slow** .

# String Literal

**String Literal** is basically some characters between double quote.

Some type of the string : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main ()
{
	const char* name = u8"Cherno";      // each char of 1byte 8bit
	const wchar_t* name2 = L"Cherno";   // each char of 4byte 32bit in linux
	const char16_t* name3 = u"Cherno";  // each char of 2byte 16bit
	const char32_t* name4 = U"Cherno";  // each char of 4byte 32bit

	const char* example = "line1"
		"line2"
		"line3";
	
	const char* ex = R"(Line1
		Line2
		Line3)";
	// R"()" is a function that we can ignore the special character and just input

	std::cout << example << std::endl;
	std::cout << ex << std::endl;


	return 0;
}
```

The out put of the code is : 

```C++
line1line2line3
Line1
		Line2
		Line3
```

So this is basically the string literal.
