**Structure binding** helps us deal with the multiple returning types of a function. As is mentioned in [10. Multiple Return Value](../03%20Advanced/10.%20Multiple%20Return%20Value.md) , we can use `struct` , `pair` , `tuple` to get the collection of different type variables . But we have talked about the uninstitution of getting the value from a pair or a tuple, because it needs to use the index and additional function to access the value . Using `std::tie` to get the value of the tuple is simpler than `std::get` , but still not easy.

```C++
#include <iostream>

std::tuple <std::string, int> CreatePerson ()
{
    return {"Cherno", 24};
}

int main (int argc, char const* argv[])
{
    std::tuple <std::string, int> person = CreatePerson ();
    std::cout << "Name : " << std::get <0> (person) << '\t' \
        << "Age : " << std::get <1> (person) << std::endl;

    // or
    std::string name;
    int age;
    std::tie (name, age) = CreatePerson ();
    std::cout << "Name : " << name  << '\t' \
        << "Age : " << age << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Also, if you use a structure to return the variables, we may find that this structure is only used once. We do not want to create structures everywhere.

So, the structure binding in C++ 17 helps us to deal with this problem :

```C++
int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
    auto [name, age] = CreatePerson ();
    std::cout << "Name : " << name  << '\t' \
        << "Age : " << age << std::endl;
        
    return 0;
}
```
