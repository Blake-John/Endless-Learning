# 01 Usage

If we want to store various types of value in a single variable, how to do it ? Such as when we run a console application and wait for input from the user, but we don't know what types of value the user will input and we just want to store that input. So the `std::variant` comes. `std::variant` can store a listed type of value.

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <variant>

int main (int argc, char const* argv[])
{
    std::variant <std::string, int> data;
    data = "Cherno";
    std::cout << std::get <std::string> (data) << std::endl;
    data = 24;
    std::cout << std::get <int> (data) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

As the code above, we can use `data` to store `std::string` or `int` type value. To get the content, we need to use `std::get ()` to get the content by **setting the variant type** . But what if I don't know what value type the variant is ? `std::variant` provides us with a method to get the index of value type `data.index ()`.

```C++
data = "Cherno";
std::cout << data.index () << std::endl; // 0
```

Besides index, `std::get_if` function is more convenient :

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <variant>

int main (int argc, char const* argv[])
{
    std::variant <std::string, int> data;
    // data = "Cherno";
    data = 2;
    if (auto value = std::get_if<std::string> (&data))
    {
        std::cout << *value << std::endl;
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << std::get <int> (data) << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

The `std::get_if ()` function accepts a pointer to variant and then tries to catch the value of the specific type. If the type is right, it will return a pointer to that type. If the type is wrong, it will return `nullptr` . So that we can use `if` to check whether it is a null pointer.

# 02 Data Stored Way

We have mentioned that the variables share the same memory block in `union` ([05. Union](05.%20Union.md)) , and computer assigns the largest size of the variables in union to union. But in variant, it will **assign the plus of the size of every type value** :

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <variant>

int main (int argc, char const* argv[])
{
    std::variant <std::string, int> data;

    std::cout << sizeof (int) << std::endl;
    std::cout << sizeof (std::string) << std::endl;
    std::cout << sizeof (data) << std::endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

The output is :

```Plain
4
32
40
```

Here the variant treats the `int` as 8 bytes.
