`std::any` is a special class which can **store any type of value** .

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <any>

int main (int argc, char const* argv[])
{
    std::any data;
    data = 2;
    data = 3.5;
    data = "Cherno";
    data = std::string ("Cherno_s");
    return 0;
}
```

In variant, we use `std::get` to get the value of variant, while in any, we use `std::any_cast ()` to get the value of the data :

```C++
std::cout << std::any_cast <std::string> (data);
```

`any` requires **dynamic memory allocation** , so that it costs additional resources than `variant` . Also, since it can cast the value to any type, it is less safe than `variant` .

You should always take it seriously to use `any` .
