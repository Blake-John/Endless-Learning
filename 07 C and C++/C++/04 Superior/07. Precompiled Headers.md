# 01 G++

A **precompiled header** is a header file which is compiled to be a binary file. By using the precompiled header, we will definitely decline the time to recompile of the project. Let's see an example :

```Plain
.
├── main.cpp
└── pch
    ├── pch.cpp
    └── pch.h
```

In this project, to build up the executable, we can use :

```Bash
g++ main.cpp -Ipch/ -std=c++17 -o main
```

To check the compilation time, we can use `time` to record the process :

```Bash
time g++ main.cpp -Ipch/ -std=c++17 -o main
```

The output is :

```Plain
________________________________________________________
Executed in  933.88 millis    fish           external
   usr time  871.89 millis    0.00 millis  871.89 millis
   sys time   54.44 millis    1.12 millis   53.31 millis
```

Which tells us the time we used to compile this project. Now, we are going to generate the precompiled header to accelerate the compile process. To generate a precompiled header, we can simply use :

```Bash
g++ -std=c++17 pch/pch.h
```

Then, `g++` will generate a compiled file `.gch` for us. By including the folder of `.gch` , we can takes the precompiled header into our compiled process. Modify `main.cpp` slightly and compile again :

```Plain
________________________________________________________
Executed in  281.33 millis    fish           external
   usr time  229.72 millis    0.00 millis  229.72 millis
   sys time   50.05 millis    1.35 millis   48.69 millis
```

This really accelerate our compile process.

# 02 CMake

We can use `target_precompile_headers ()` to generate the precompile headers and link it to a target .

```CMake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(PCH)

add_executable(main main.cpp)
target_include_directories(main PRIVATE pch)
target_precompile_headers(main PRIVATE ./pch/pch.h)
```
