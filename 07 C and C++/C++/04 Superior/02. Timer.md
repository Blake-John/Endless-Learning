# 01 Timing Personally

In this section we are going to talk about how to timing the duration of a program.

To timing the duration, different platforms provides their own timing solutions. But there is a common C++ library that is suitable for all platforms and it precision is high enough. This library is `chrono` .

The function `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now ()` takes the time right now. To save the time count, we can use `auto` to set the variable type, and the difference between two time counts is a struct storing the time information :

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>

int main (int argc, char const* argv[])
{
    auto start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now ();
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++)
        {
            std::cout << "i : " << i << '\t' << "j : " << j << std::endl;
        }
    }
    auto end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now ();
    auto duration = end - start;
    std::cout << duration.count () << "s" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

By moving the cursor on the variables `start` and `end` , we can find that their types are `std::chrono::_V2::system_clock::time_point` **in Linux system** . And the type of `duration` is `std::chrono::nanosecond` , which means that the time duration **is in nanosecond** . But we can cast the time duration **to be in second** by setting the variable type personally :

```C++
std::chrono::duration <double> duration = end - start;
```

# 02 Timing Automatically

Besides timing personally by coding before and after a function is called, we can **define a structure to timing the duration of a scope with the constructor and destructor** .

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>

struct Timer
{
    std::chrono::_V2::system_clock::time_point start, end;
    std::chrono::duration <double> duration;

    Timer ()
    {
        start = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now ();
    }
    ~Timer ()
    {
        end = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now ();
        duration = end - start;
        double ms = duration.count () * 1000.;

        std::cout << "Counted time : " << ms << " ms" << std::endl;
    }
};

void hello ()
{
    Timer timer;
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
    {
        std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;
    }
    
}

int main (int argc, char const* argv[])
{
    hello ();
    return 0;
}
```
