We have talked about the l_values and r_values, so that we know all the values are stored in memory no matter whether there is a variable to store the value. But if we use the temporary value (r_values) to construct an instant, the program will **create a new instant and copy the temporary one to the new one** . Can we not perform the copy step and just **use the value stored in memory as a new variable** ? The answer is yes and this is called **move** . We move the temporary buffer of memory as a new buffer of one variable.

# 01 Perform Move Personally

```C++
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

class String
{
  public:
    String() = default;
    String (const char* string)
    {
        this->size = strlen (string);
        this->m_str = new char[this->size];
        memcpy (this->m_str, string, this->size);
        std::cout << "Created !" << std::endl;
    }

    ~String ()
    {
        std::cout << "Destoried !" << std::endl;
        delete this->m_str;
    }

    String (const String& other)
    {
        this->size = other.size;
        this->m_str = new char[this->size];
        memcpy (this->m_str, other.m_str, this->size);
        std::cout << "Copied !" << std::endl;
    }

    String (String&& other)
    {
        this->size = other.size;
        this->m_str = other.m_str;
        std::cout << "Moved !" << std::endl;
        other.m_str = nullptr;
        other.size = 0;
    }

    void Print ()
    {
        for (u_int32_t i = 0; i < this->size; i++)
        {
            std::cout << this->m_str[i];
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

  private:
    char* m_str;
    u_int32_t size = 0;
};

class Entity
{
  public:
    Entity (const char* name)
        : m_name (name)
    {
    }

    Entity (const String& name)
        : m_name (name)
    {
    }

    Entity (String&& name)
        : m_name ((String&&)name)
    {
    }

    void PrintName ()
    {
        this->m_name.Print ();
    }

  private:
    String m_name;
};

int main (int argc, char const* argv[])
{
    Entity entity (String ("Cherno"));
    entity.PrintName ();

    return 0;
}
```

In the code above, we use a temporary value `String ("Cherno")` to construct an instant of `Entity` . The most important step is to write a move constructor :

```C++
String (String&& other)
{
    this->size = other.size;
    this->m_str = other.m_str;
    std::cout << "Moved !" << std::endl;
    other.m_str = nullptr;
    other.size = 0;
}
```

We just perform a **shallow copy, which is just assigning the memory address to the** **`m_str`** **of the new instant** . But there is a problem that, if the temporary value is destroyed, the `m_str` of the new instant will also be free. So it is important to set the `other.m_str` to be a `nullptr` .

# 02 `std::move`

`std::move` can mark a target as a temporary value . It is the same as using the type casting but we do not need to specify what type we want to cast.

```C++
Entity (String&& name)
    : m_name (std::move (name))
{
}
```

Then, we can overload the = operator to move the temporary value when using = to assign a variable :

```C++
String& operator = (String&& other)
{
    if (this != &other)
    {
        if (!this.m_str)
        {
            delete this->m_str;
        }

        this->m_str = other.m_str;
        this->size = other.size;
        
        other.m_str = nullptr;
        other.size = 0;
    }
    return *this;
}
```

**We need to free old memory to avoid memory leaks**. But if someone moves a value to itself (emmm...), it will delete the value. So we need to add an `if` statement to judge whether the moved object and the destination is the same.

Now, let's look at the code below :

```C++
int main (int argc, char const* argv[])
{
    String apple ("Cherno");
    String dest;

    std::cout << "Apple : ";
    apple.Print ();
    std::cout << "Dest : ";
    dest.Print ();

    dest = std::move (apple);
    std::cout << "Apple : ";
    apple.Print ();
    std::cout << "Dest : ";
    dest.Print ();

    return 0;
}
```

The output is :

```Plain
Created !
Apple : Cherno
Dest : 
Apple : 
Dest : Cherno
Destoried !
Destoried !
```
