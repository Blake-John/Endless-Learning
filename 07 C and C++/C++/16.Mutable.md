`mutable` is a keyword opposite to `const` , which means the variables can be changed. 

If we have a class `Entity`  : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public :
		Entity ();
		const char* GetName () const
		{
			return m_Name;
		}
	private :
		const char* m_Name;
		int debugCount = 0;
};


int main ()
{
	const Entity e;
	e.GetName ();
}
```

If we want to debug the code and find how many times the method `GetName ()` is called, we may need to add an attribute `debugCount` to count the number. But since the method `GetName ()` is marked as `const` , we can't change the attributes in the method.

So we can use the `mutable` keyword to set the `debugCount` to be mutable : 

```C++
class Entity
{
	public :
		Entity ();
		const char* GetName () const
		{
			return m_Name;
		}
	private :
		const char* m_Name;
		mutable int debugCount = 0;
};
```
