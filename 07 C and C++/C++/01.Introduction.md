# 1.1 About C++
## 1.1.1 Why is efficient？
- We need only a complier to run the C++ program in any platform
- other language need to transform to other mid-language,like C# or Java

## 1.1.2 What to learn?
- C++ how to work
- talk about **memories** and **points**
- 自定义函数
- templates、底层优化、宏、数据结构

## 1.1.3 What we need?
- a computer
	- Windows
	- Linux
- IDE
	- Visual Studio
	- ~~Visual Studio Code~~
		- because it does not include the complier of C++
	- Dev
	- ...

# 1.2 About IDE
## 1.2.1 Visual Studio
- it is not supported in Linux

## 1.2.2 VSCode
- VSCode is a great editor
- but VSCode in Linux require some other tools,like
	- CMake
	- G++/GCC/GDB

## 1.2.3 CodeLite
- we can install some supported tools by
```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ codelite cmake
```

# 1.3 A quick start
- actualy, we will use Cmake to build our executable file to run the C++ program
- so, let's have a quick start in how to write a C++ program and run it

## 1.3.1 write the C++ program
- add a new file named "main.cpp"
- open it in any editor and input
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main ()
{
	std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
	std::cin.get ();

	return 0;
}
```

## 1.3.2 write the CMakeLists.txt
- we need to write a file to build up our executable program
- add a new file named "CMakeLists.txt" and input
```CMake
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.10)

project (Helloworld)

set (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -Wall -Werror -std=c++14")
set (source_dir ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src)

file (GLOB source_files "${source_dir}/*.cpp")

add_executable (HelloWorld ${source_files})
```
```ad-tip
more information about CMake you can see [[CMake]]
```
[[../CMake/CMake Commands| ]]
## 1.3.3 start to build up the executable file
- make a new directory named "build" and change the workspace into it
- input the command in the terminal
```bash
cmake ..
make
```
- and than we can get some build files and a executable file named "HelloWorld"
- than we can run it !
```bash
./HelloWorld
```

```ad-tip
now,the file structure is following
```
```
