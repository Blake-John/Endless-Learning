**Loop** is to tell the compiler to run the code many times
# `for`
```C++
	for (<part1>; <part2>; <part3>)
	{
		<codes>
	}
```
- `<part1>` is a **variable declaration**
	- `i` is the abbrv of `iterate` , which mean we will iterate something
- `<part2>` is **conditions**
	- when the condition is **true** , the loop will continue
		- it is said that the program will jump into the body follow
		- and will go back to the beginning of the loop
	- if the condition is `false` , the loop will be shut down
- `<part3>` is some code will be called **at the end of this time of loop (before next loop)**
```C++
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
		std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
	}
```
```ad-tip
`<part1>` and `<part3>` can be empty, you can do anything by change the way writing the code, such as:
```
```C++
	int i = 0;
	for (; i < 5;)
	{
		std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
		i++;
	}
	// or

	bool condition = true;
	for (int i = 0; condition; i++)
	{
		std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
		if (!(i < 5))
		{
			condition = false;
		}
	}
```
# `while`
```C++
	while (<condition>)
	{
		<codes>
	}
```
- `while` will run the code when the `<condition>` is `true`
```C++
	int i = 0;
	while (i < 5)
	{
		std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
		i++;
	}
```
# `do-while`
```C++
	do
	{
		<codes>
	} while (<condition>);
```
- `do-while` will run the code follow **at least once**
-
