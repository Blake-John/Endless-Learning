# Why we need Conditions ?
- because when we write codes, we need to evaluate whether to run the codes, run which codes
- but conditions will **take up a big resource**, which leads to **slowing down** the program
# How to write conditions ?
## if
```Cpp
if (<conditions>)
{
	<codes>
}
```
- when the `<conditions>` is `true` , it will run the code follow
- the condition actually is a **bool type**
	- `0` is `false`
	- every **number excpet 0** is `true`
- so we can set the condition **only some datas**

## else
- it will run the code **only** when **the condition in `if` is `false`**
```Cpp
if (<conditions>)
{
	<codes>
}
else
{
	<codes>
}
```
