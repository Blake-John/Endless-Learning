# 01 Constant Variables and Pointers

## 1.1 constant variables

`const` keyword tell the people that the **variables are unvariable** , that is, the value of the variables would not change. To define a constant variable, we just : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main ()
{
	const int MAX_AGE = 90;

	int* a = new int;
	
	*a = 2;
	std::cout << *a << std::endl;

	a = (int*)&MAX_AGE;
	std::cout << *a << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

In the code above, `MAX_AGE` is a **constant variable** so that the value of `MAX_AGE` could not be changed. `a` is a normal pointer, not a constant pointer, so that we can change the **content that the pointer point to** , or we can **change the memory address that the pointer point to** . But the type of `&MAX_AGE` is `const int*` , so we need to convert the type to `int*` and then we can assign the memory address to `a` .

## 1.2 constant pointers

- The first way to add `const` for `a` is to add `const` before `int*` or before `*` : 

```C++
const int *a = new int;
// or
int const *a = new int;
```

We will find that the IDE gives us an error `Read-only variable is not assignable`  at the line `*a = 2;` , that means **we can't change the content of the pointer** .

- The second way to add `const` for `a` is to add `const` after `int*` : 

```C++
int* const a = new int;
```

In this case, the function of `const` is opposite to the first time. We will find that the  IDE gives us an error `Cannot assign to variable 'a' with const-qualified type 'int *const'` at the line `a = (int*)&MAX_AGE` , that means **we can't change where the pointer point to in the memory** .

- The third type of the constant pointer is : 

```C++
const int* const a = new int;
// or
int const * const a = new int;
```

This time, the code means that **we can neither change where the pointer point in the memory nor the content of the pointer** .

> - `int const *a = new int;` or `const int *a = new int;` puts the `const` before `*a` . And `*a` means to **dereference the variable `a` and get the *content* of `a`** , so that it tells us **the dereference of `a` is constant** . This is why we can 't' change the content of `a` .
> - `int* const a = new int;` puts the `const` before `a` . And `a` is **exactly a pointer which need to point to somewhere** , so that it tells us **`a` is unchanged and it points to only one address in memory, that is, the address `a` point to is constant** . This is why we can't change where the pointer points to.

# 02 `const` in Class

The `const` in the class is to declare the method that **the method can not change the attributes in the class** : 

```C++
class Entity
{
	private : 
		int m_x, m_y;

	public :
		int GetX () const
		{
			m_x = 2;
			return m_x;
		}
};
```

The code above will lead to an error `Cannot assign to non-static data member within const member function 'Getx'` , which means we can't write `m_x` but we can read `m_x` .

And if we want to write a method to set the value of `m_x` , `m_y` , we can't write the `const` : 

```C++
class Entity
{
	private : 
		int m_x, m_y;

	public :
		int GetX () const
		{
			m_x = 2;
			return m_x;
		}

		void SetX (int x) const
		{
			m_x = x;
		}
};
```

This is a wrong code that we need to change the value of `m_x` but we set the method `SetX ()` to be `const` .

## What if `m_x` is a pointer ? 

```C++
class Entity
{
	private : 
		int* m_x, m_y;

	public :
		int* GetX () const
		{
			return m_x;
		}

		void SetX (int* x)
		{
			m_x = x;
		}
};
```

But the code above is **logistically wrong !** We return `m_x` and the address of `m_x` may be assigned to a pointer `a` , while `a` is not a constant pointer points to constant. That means, **we can change `m_x` by the returned pointer `a`** . This actually **break the regulation that `GetX ()` could not change the attribute of class**. So that to obey the regulation that `GetX () const` could not change the member of class, we need to write the code : 

```C++
class Entity
{
	private : 
		int* m_x, m_y;

	public :
		int const * const GetX () const
		{
			return m_x;
		}

		void SetX (int* x)
		{
			m_x = x;
		}
};
```

> [!attention] 
> `int* m_x, m_y;` 
> 
> Code above maybe confuse some people because **`m_x` is a pointer but `m_y` is a normal variable.**
> 
> To make `m_y` also be a pointer, we need to write the code as `int* m_x, * m_y` .

## What `const` contributes to in class ?

Let's see the code followed : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	private : 
		int* m_x, m_y;

	public :
		int* GetX () 
		{
			return m_x;
		}

		void SetX (int* x)
		{
			m_x = x;
		}
};

void PrintEntity (const Entity& e)
{
	std::cout << e.GetX () << std::endl;
}

int main ()
{
	const int MAX_AGE = 90;

	int const * const a = new int;
	

	return 0;
}
```

We can see that if we throw out the `const` after `GetX ()` and we want to write a function `PrintEntity ()` and pass a constant reference of class instant `e` to the function, then we can find that the IDE throw out an error `'this' argument to member function 'GetX' has type 'const Entity', but function is not marked const` . This means that **we can not use the non-const function from the class** because **the parameter `e` of `PrintEntity ()` is a *const reference*** . Since the parameter `e` is a const reference, we **can not change the object of what is passed to the function**, neither the class's own method. Because `GetX ()` is not marked as const, so that **the function `GetX ()` may change the passed parameter `e`** , which is not permitted.
