# 3.1 Why we need variable?
actually, most of the program is using datas and manipulating datas
- stock the datas
- use the datas
the difference of datas -> the size of data
# 3.2 How to declare a new variable?
```Cpp
int a = 8;
<type> <variable_name> <value>;
```
in C++ we can give the variable a value when it was defined, but we can also not.
## 3.2.1 int
- a sign integer, which have a size of **4 bytes**
- stock the number from -2 billion to 2 billion
```ad-tip
**1 bite** often is a **8 bit binary number**

a sign integer have **32 bits**, in which 1 bit have to **form the sign**

so there leaves about 2^31 positive numbers
```
## 3.2.2 unsigned int
- now we have **32 bits** to stock an integer
- so we can stock to a maximum integer of **2^32**
## 3.2.3 char
- 1 bite data
- traditionally to be used to stock **character**, not just to stock number
	- but actually the **character is just a number**
	- such as `'A'` is `65`
```Cpp
int main ()
{
	char a = 'A';
	cout << a << endl;

	char b = 65;
	cout << b;
}
```
- the result of the program above is 
```
A
A
```
- it is because the key identifer **char** tells the compiler the variable stocks **character** instead of number
- but it is up to the programer
```ad-question
#### Why the character is number?
- it is because in the computer, what we really stock is **a string of binary number**
- if we want to present a character, we should **follow some norms** to use **a special string of binary numbers** to represent it
- the norms often are ASCII and UTF
	- in ASCII, `A` is represented by a 8 bits binary number which transformed into a decimal number is `65`
```

```ad-seealso
except for `unsigned`, there are other key identifers which can regulate the quantity of the variable
#### short
- a `short` type variable is **2 bytes**
#### long
- a `long` type variable is **4 bytes**
```
## 3.2.4 float
- a **decimal fraction** occupies **4 bytes**
- such as `5.5`
	- but actually if we type the program bellow
	```Cpp
	int main ()
	{
	float variable = 5.5;
	cout << variable << endl;
	cin.get ();
	}
	```
	- and move our mouse on the variable name, we will find that the IDE tells us that it is a **double** type number
		- if we want to define a real `float` number, we should add a identifer `f` after the number
		- such as `float variable = 5.5f`
		- But ! the memory size of the `variable` above is still **4 bytes**, because the computer just give it 4 bytes memory address
## 3.2.5 double
- 8 bytes data
## 3.2.6 bool
- `bool` have only two values : `true` and `false`
- `false` is stock as `0` in computer
- `true` is stock as **any interger except 0**
	- but the computer will output `1` as the value of `true`
	- so if you define `bool a = 5;` and output `a` , the computer will print `1` in screen
```ad-attention
`bool` is **1 byte data** !
#### Why?
- it is because when computer dealing with addressing memory, it **can not address individual bit**
- we can only address at a minimum size of **byte**
- so we can not create a 1 bit variable
```
# 3.3 How to get the size of variables?
`sizeof (<variable>)`
- the function `sizeof` can get the size of the variable **in byte**
