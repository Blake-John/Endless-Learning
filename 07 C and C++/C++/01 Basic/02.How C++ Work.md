# 2.1 The Program

Let's see a C++ file

![](01%20Basic/01.Introduction.md#^4768fd)

## 2.1.1 Preprocess

- the first line `#include <iostream>` is **Preprocess Statement**
	- `include` means find a **file** what we call **Head File**, such as `iostream`
	- why we need `iostream` is we need a functioin named `cout` to print something on terminal

```ad-tip
`include` is going to **copy** the `Head File` and **paste** it into this file
```

## 2.1.2 Main Function

- a main function is a **Entry Point**, from which the computer execute the program
	- computer will execute the function **line by line**
	- `int` define the `main` function's return value

```ad-tip
- **all** the functions need a return value **except** `main`
- if we have no return value, the main function will **automatically return `0`**
```

## 2.1.3 Overloaded Operator

- overloaded operator `<<` is actually a **function**
	- the other mean of `<<` is **pushing** the following string `"Helloworld"` into `cout` and **pushing** the `endl` into `cout` which tells the terminal to bounce to next line
	- `cin.get ()` will **puase** the program execution utill we press the `Enter`

## 2.1.4 Declaration

- every kind of symbols in C++ need to be **declaration**
	- `std` is the **namespace** of function `cout`
	- we use `std::` to declare the `cout` funciton


> [!faq] 
> #### What the difference between **declaraton** and **definition**?
> - declaration is going to tell the compiler **where** the function is and the function **exist**
> - definitioin is going to tell the compiler **what** the function is
> the declaration and definition of the function must match
> > it is said that the type and the name of the function should be the same

# 2.2 The Steps to Build a Executable File
## 2.2.1 Preprocess Statement

- compiler will **read the prepocess statements** and copy the head file into this file, so that we can using the function included in `Head File`, such as `cout`/`cin` in `iostream`

## 2.2.2 Compiled

- in this stage the compiler transforms all the C++ codes into the **machine code**, and we can set some important settings to regulate our compling procedure
- we will use `CMake` to help us generate the `Makefile` , and use `make` to finish the Compiling --> see [CMake](../../CMake/CMake%20Commands.md) 

## 2.2.3 Link

- **every** C++ code will be compiled to an objecct, if we have not only a C++ code file, these codes will be compiled into some **seperate objects**
- so in the main function, if we need to use **the functions in other files,** we need to **link** the file included the funciton we need with the main function file
- if we build the whole project instead of a single file, all the files will be compiled, in which linker will **find** the definition of log function and **import** the function into the **main function**

> [!note] 
> the linker's job is to **resolve the symbo**l and **wire up functions**, and **intergrate** all the object into a executable file

> [!example] 
> in visual studio
> - if you press `ctrl` + `F7`, the compiler will **compile** the target file, in this step, the linker doesn't work
> 	- if the error information start wiht `C`, it is said that error happened in compiling stage
> - but if you choose the whole project and select `build`, it will build up the whole project by compiling each file and **linking** the files together to get a main executable file
> 	- if the error information start with `LNK`, it is said that error happened in linking stage

> [!attention] 
> #### A Special LINKING Error
> **Multiple Definition**
> 
> - if the `Head File` of the function `function1` is included **more than a time**, it still will get a **linking error**, because it is like to define `function1` more than a time

> [!seealso] 
> How to solve the error **Multiple Definition**?
> - **static**
> 	- static will set the function **only in the file where it is defined**, so it will not be linked with other file
> - **inline**
> 	- inline will **insert** the function's **content** into where it is invoked
> 		- it is said that the code of the function will be copy to where it is needed

> [!tip] 
>- `compiling` tell the computer that there is some functions we need
> - `linking` tell the computer where the function is
