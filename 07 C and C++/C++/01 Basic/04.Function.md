# What is function

- function is designed to finish some tasks we need

# Why we need function?

- **avoid to repeat copying** the same codes in the program
- more convinient to **change the details** in the same function codes

# How to define a function?

- a basic function is consisting of
	- type
	- function name
	- input parameters
	- codes
	- return value

```Cpp
<type> <name> (<variable type> <variable name>,...)
{
	<codes>
}

int Multiply (int a, int b)
{
	return a * b;
}
```

- but if the function isn't need a return function, we can define the function type as `void`

```Cpp
void Multiply (int a, int b)
{
	cout << a * b << endl;
}
```

> we can use function to simplify our codes, but we shouldn't take apart our program by each line.

> - it is **hard to read**
> - it is **hard to maintain**
> - it will make your **program slower**
> 	- why? see [How the program works in memory](../03%20Advanced/06.%20new.md) 

- and, in real work, we will spilt the function into **declaration** and **definition**, which will be seperately saved in **head file** and **source file**.
