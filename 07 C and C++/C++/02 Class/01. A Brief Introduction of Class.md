# Chapter 1 : A Brief Introduction of Class
## 1.1 What is Class  ?

- In brief, class is a method to **group datas and functionalities together**
## 1.2 Why we need Class ?

- In the game programming, we need a character with some attributes.
- If we write the code by the method of procedure oriented, it will be

```Cpp
int main ()
{
	// we are going to write some attributes of the character
	// such as its position and moving speed
	int x, y;
	int speed;
}
```

- the code above seems not to be so strange, but the variable has no exact meaning, so we may

```Cpp
int main ()
{
	// we are going to write some attributes of the character
	// such as its position and moving speed
	int PlayerX, PlayerY;
	int PlayerSpeed;
}
```

- it looks great !
- but if we are going to add another character, we need to do so

```Cpp
int main ()
{
	// we are going to add another character
	int Player1X, Player1Y;
	int Player2X, Player2Y;
	int Player1Speed;
	int Player2Speed;
}
```

- it is going to be somewhat confusion, what if we add the third character ?

> In order to promote the reusing of code and make it easier to maintain, we need the method of [[00. OOP|OOP]] , in which, the concept of class is important

## 1.3 How to use a Class ?
### 1.3.1 create a class

```Cpp
class <name>
{
	<codes>
};
```

```ad-tip
- the **name of the class must be the only one** 
- Comparision with the function, **there must be a `;` after the definition of a class**
```

- so we can write the code above like : 

```Cpp
class Player
{
	int x, y;
	int speed;
};
```

- by now, we have successfully create a data type named `Player`

### 1.3.2 use the class

- since the **class is just a new type of data** , we can use it to create an **object** like we defining other type of variables

```Cpp
Player player;
```

- variables made from class type are called **objects** , and new object variable is called **instance**

### 1.3.3 edit the object
#### 01 Access the variables in the class

- if now we going to `main` function, and write

```Cpp
int main ()
{
	player.x = 5;
}
```

- it will get an error
	- `cannot access private member declared in class "Player"`
- it is because by default, the every member in a class is **private**
	- which means only the **function inde that class can access these members**
- so we can set these variables be `public`

```Cpp
class Player
{
	public :
		int x, y;
		int speed;
};

int main ()
{
	Player player;
	player.x = 5;
}
```

#### 02 The function in the class

- we wants to write a function to control the character to move (change the position variables) , we can

```Cpp
void Move (Player &player, int dx, int dy)
{
	player.x += dx * player.speed;
	player.y += dy * player.speed;
}

int main ()
{
	Move (player, 5, 5);
}
```

- but exactly, we can move the `Move` function into the class, because a class can contain some function
	- function inside the class is called **method**

```Cpp
class Player
{
	public :
		int x, y;
		int speed;

		void Move (int dx, int dy)
		{
			x += dx * speed;
			y += dy * speed;
		}
};

int main ()
{
	player.Move (1, -1);
}
```
