# Chapter 2 : The Difference between Class and Structure

There almost no difference between class and struct : 

- the member in **class** is **private by default**
- but the member in **struct** is **public by default**

## Why the `struct` still exist in C++ ?

- because the C++ need to **be compatible with the old standard and C**
	- we can use `struct` to group some datas, just the collection of datas
	- we can use `class` to create a object with many complex attributes and methods
