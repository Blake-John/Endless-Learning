A virtual Desturctor is somewhat different from a [Virtual Function](07.%20Virtual%20Function.md) . **The virtual function makes sure that you can access the overrided subclass method by pointer if the content of the pointer is truly a subclass while the type of the pointer is parent class** . Such as :

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public :
		const char* GetName () { return "Entity"; }
};

class Player : public Entity
{
	private :
		const char* m_Name;

	public :
		Player (const char* name) : m_Name (name) {}
		
		const char* GetName () { return m_Name; }
};

int main ()
{
        Player* p = new Player ("Cherno");
        std::cout << p->GetName () << std::endl;

        Entity* entity = p;
        std::cout << entity->GetName () << std::endl;

        return 0;
}
```

In the code above, we use **a pointer with type of** **`Entity`** **and content of** **`Player`** **to access** **`GetName ()`** **in** **`Player`** .

But a virtual destructor let the compile call the destructor by parent type instead of replace it. Let's see another example :

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
	private:
	    /* data */
	public:
	    Base() { std::cout << "Base Constructed !" << std::endl; }
	    ~Base() { std::cout << "Base Destructed !" << std::endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base
{
private:
    /* data */
public:
    Derived () { std::cout << "Derived Constructed !" << std::endl; }
    ~Derived () { std::cout << "Derived Destructed !" << std::endl; }
};

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
    Base* base = new Base ();
    delete base;
    std::cout << "--------------------------\n";
    
    Derived* derived = new Derived ();
    delete derived;
    std::cout << "--------------------------\n";

    return 0;
}
```

Here is a type `Base` and a derived type `Derived` . The output of the code will be :

```SQL
Base Constructed !
Base Destructed !
--------------------------
Base Constructed !
Derived Constructed !
Derived Destructed !
Base Destructed !
--------------------------
```

It is normal right ? But what if we write the code below ?

```C++
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
   
    Base* derived = new Derived ();
    delete derived;
    std::cout << "--------------------------\n";

    return 0;
}
```

The output will be :

```SQL
Base Constructed !
Derived Constructed !
Base Destructed !
--------------------------
```

Here the program **does not call the destructor of** **`Derived`** **, which may lead to a memory leak** . Such as if we have an array on the heap in `Derived` , and we will free the memory in `~Derived ()` , but the destructor of `Derived` will not be called, which may lead to a memory leak :

```C++
class Derived : public Base
{
private:
    int* m_Array;
public:
    Derived () { this->m_Array = new int[5]; std::cout << "Derived Constructed !" << std::endl; }
    ~Derived () { delete this->m_Array; std::cout << "Derived Destructed !" << std::endl; }
};
```

To solve this problem, we can set the destructor of `Base` to be a **virtual destructor** . Then the compiler will generate a v-table and then find and call the destructor of `Derived` when the object is deleted :

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Base
{
	private:
	    /* data */
	public:
	    Base() { std::cout << "Base Constructed !" << std::endl; }
	    virtual ~Base() { std::cout << "Base Destructed !" << std::endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base
{
	private:
	    int* m_Array;
	public:
	    Derived () { this->m_Array = new int[5]; std::cout << "Derived Constructed !" << std::endl; }
	    ~Derived () override { delete this->m_Array; std::cout << "Derived Destructed !" << std::endl; }
};

int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{   
    Base* derived = new Derived ();
    delete derived;
    std::cout << "--------------------------\n";

    return 0;
}
```

The output of the code above is :

```SQL
Base Constructed !
Derived Constructed !
Derived Destructed !
Base Destructed !
--------------------------
```

> Not that it is better to set `~Derived` to be `override` function .
