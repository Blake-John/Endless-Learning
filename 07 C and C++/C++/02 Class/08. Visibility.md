# Chapter 8 : Visibility

**Visibility** is a important concept in OOP and demands that **who can see the attributes or methods** , **who can call them** , and **who can use them** .

The basic keyword to decorate the attributes and methods is :

- `public` - **can be accessed in every where**
- `private` - **Only* this class can access the attributes or methods** 
- `protected` - **Only* the related class can access the members** 

> [!note] 
> #### Default Type
> If you not define a visibility type in a class or a struct, then
> 
> - `public` - the default visibility type in **struct** 
> - `private` - the default visibility type in **class** 

That is, the code below two blocks are the same : 

```C++
struct Entity_s
{
	int a, b;
};

class Entity_c
{
	int a, b;
};
```

```C++
struct Entity_s
{
	public :
		int a, b;
};

class Entity_c
{
	private :
		int a, b;
};
```

## 8.1 `private` 

`private` means **Only* *in* this class an access the attributes or methods*** . If you try to access the attributes or methods out side the field of the class **such as in another function or in main function** , it will lead to an error.

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public :
		Entity ()
		{
			X = 1;
			Y = 2;
			Print ();
		}
		
	private :
		int X, Y;
		void Print () {}
};

class Player : public Entity
{
	public :
		Player ()
		{
			X = 2;
			Print ();
		}
};

int main ()
{
	Entity e;
	e.Print ();
	std::cout << e.X << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

The code above try to call the **private attribute** `X` and **private method** `Print ()` of class `Entity` in `main` function or class `Player` , this will fail to compile because we call the private member out side the class `Entity` .

> [!note] 
> #### Why Only plus \*
> This is because there is a keyword `friend` that can let some function or class to be the friend of this class and then they can access the private attributes or methods.

## 8.2 `protected` 

`protected` is little more visible than `private` but less visible than `public` . `protected` means that **only* in the class or in subclass can access the members and in other also could not access the members** .

```C++
class Entity
{
	public :
		Entity ()
		{
			X = 1;
			Y = 2;
			Print ();
		}
		
	protected :
		int X, Y;
		void Print () {}
};
```

If we set `X` , `Y` , `Print ()` to be `protected` , then, we can access `X` , `Y` in the subclass `Player` and call the function `Print ()` in `Player` . But we still could not access them in `main` function.

## 8.3 `public` 

`public` means **you can access the member in every where** such as in the class, in subclass, in main function ...
