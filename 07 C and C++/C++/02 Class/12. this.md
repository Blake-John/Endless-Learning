We have a special keyword `this` in C++. By this keyword, we can **access the members in the class** .

> [!note] 
> The **variables** in the class are called **attributes** , and the **functions** in the class are called **methods** . The attributes and functions all are the **members of the class** 

Especially in a method, we can **dereference `this` to access our instant** . So `this` is actually **a pointer to the instant to which the method belongs to** .

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public :
		Entity (int x, int y)
		{
			x = x;
			y = y;
		}
		
	private :
		int x, y;
};
```

Assume that we have such a class with such a constructor, but we will find that the constructor actually **do nothing** . But if we want to write the initialization in the constructor instead of using initializer list, we can use `this` to access the `x` , `y` in the class : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public :
		Entity (int x, int y)
		{
			this->x = x;
			this->y = y;
		}
		
	private :
		int x, y;
};
```

or this is the same as :

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public :
		Entity (int x, int y)
		{
			(*this).x = x;
			(*this).y = y;
		}
		
	private :
		int x, y;
};
```

Let's see more about the type of `this` : 

```C++
Entity (int x, int y)
{
	Entity* e = this;
	e->x = x;
	e->y = y;
}
```

The type of `this` in `Entity (int x, int y)` is `Entity*` or more exactly `Entity* const` , because **if we want to write `this = nullptr` , it will lead to an error**. That means we can't reassign the memory address to `this` . **`this` is only point to the instant itself** . So if we want to reference `this` , we **should write `Entity* const & e = this;` rather than `Entity* e & e = this;`** 

Now, we add a new method `GetX () const` in the class to get the attribute `x` : 

```C++
void GetX () const
{
	// this->x = 5; // this will lead to an error
	return this->x;
}
```

This time, the type of `this` is actually `const Entity* const` , so that **we can't change the content of `this` , which means that we can't modify the instant** .

Another function of `this` is to pass the instant as a parameter : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public :
		Entity (int x, int y);
		int GetX () const
		{
			return this->x;
		}

	private :
		int x, y;
};

void PrintEntity (const Entity* const e)
{
	// PrintSomething
}

Entity::Entity (int x, int y)
{
	Entity* e = this;
	e->x = x;
	e->y = y;
	PrintEntity (this);
}
```
