# 01 Copy

## 1.1 Copy and Not to Copy

**Copy** refers to copy in data, copy in memory. Sometimes copy can do a favour to us, but in some case, copy will lead to the waste of performance. Is there any method to just read the data but do not add memory usage ?

Let's see a simple example :

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main ()
{
	int a = 2;
	int b = a;

	return 0;
}
```

In the code above, we actually **make a copy of** **`a`** **since** **`a`** **,** **`b`** **are two different variables and they have their own memory assignment**. The example in structure and class is the same.

Let's see another example :

```C++
#include <iostream>

struct Vector2
{
	float x, y;
};

int main ()
{
	Vector2* a = new Vector2 ();
	Vector2* b = a;
	b->x = 2;
	std::cout << a->x << std::endl; // 2

	return 0;
}
```

In the code above, we use `new` to assign a memory address to **pointer** **`a`** , and then we use = to assign `a` to `b` . This time we do not use copy since they share the same memory address. When `b` changes, `a` also changes.

## 1.2 Copy in class
### 1.2.1 Prepare the class

Let's write a `String` class to see how the copy works in class :

```C++
class String
{
	public :
		String (const char* string)
		{
			m_Size = strlen (string);
			m_Buffer = new char[m_Size];
			// memcpy (m_Buffer, string, m_Size);
			strcpy (m_Buffer, string); // with the termination character
		}
	private :
		char* m_Buffer;
		unsigned int m_Size;
};
```

In this class, we declare an `int` variable `m_Size` to save the length of the string, and a `char` array to store the data of the string.

If we want to print out the `String` class, we can [overload]() the operator `<<` to print out the content of the string :

```C++
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

class String
{
	public :
		String (const char* string)
		{
			m_Size = strlen (string);
			m_Buffer = new char[m_Size];
			// memcpy (m_Buffer, string, m_Size);
			strcpy (m_Buffer, string); // with the termination character
		}
		const char* GetString () const
		{
			return m_Buffer;
		}
	private :
		char* m_Buffer;
		unsigned int m_Size;
};

std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& stream, const String& string)
{
	stream << string.GetString ();
	return stream;
}

int main ()
{
	String str ("Cherno");
	std::cout << str << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

Instead of writing a `GetString ()` method, we can simply use `friend` to declare the overloaded operator **to be a [friend](08.%20Visibility.md#8.1%20`Private`) of** **`String`** :

```C++
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

class String
{
	public :
		String (const char* string)
		{
			m_Size = strlen (string);
			m_Buffer = new char[m_Size];
			// memcpy (m_Buffer, string, m_Size);
			strcpy (m_Buffer, string); // with the termination character
		}
		const char* GetString () const
		{
			return m_Buffer;
		}
		friend std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& stream, const String& string);
	private :
		char* m_Buffer;
		unsigned int m_Size;
};

std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& stream, const String& string)
{
	stream << string.m_Buffer;
	return stream;
}

int main ()
{
	String str ("Cherno");
	std::cout << str << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

Then we can simply refer to the `m_Buffer` in the operator `<<` .

> [!attention]
> 
> Actually, we have a memory leak because we do not call `delete` after `new` . We need to add a destructor to free the memory :

```C++
class String
{
	public :
		String (const char* string)
		{
			m_Size = strlen (string);
			m_Buffer = new char[m_Size];
			// memcpy (m_Buffer, string, m_Size);
			strcpy (m_Buffer, string);
		}
		const char* GetString () const
		{
			return m_Buffer;
		}
		friend std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& stream, const String& string);
		~String ()
		{
			delete m_Buffer;
		}
	private :
		char* m_Buffer;
		unsigned int m_Size;
};
```

### 1.2.2 Copy the class

Let's see the code below :

```C++
int main ()
{
	String str ("Cherno");
	String str_ = str;
	std::cout << str << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

The code seems to be normal, but if we run it to the end, it will **raise an error** :

```
free(): double free detected in tcache 2
fish: Job 1, './copy' terminated by signal SIGABRT (Abort)
```

The error tells us that **we double free the memory**, that is, **we use** **`delete`** **to the same object twice** .

#### 1.  Why would the code raise this error ?

It is because when we write the code `String str_ = str;` , we actually **copy all the value of the member of** **`str`** and then **assign them to a new instant** **`str_`** . But attention ! The value of pointer `m_Buffer` is exactly **the memory address** . It means that we **assign the same memory address to two instant attributes** **`str.m_Buffer`** **,** **`str_.m_Buffer`** . When the program ends, the destructor of two instant will free the memory address, since their `m_Buffer` points to the same memory address, the `delete` will free the same memory twice, which is illegal.

#### 2. An insight to the `m_Buffer`

Let's have a brief insight into copied instant attribute `m_Buffer` :

```C++
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <strings.h>

class String
{
	public :
		String (const char* string)
		{
			m_Size = strlen (string);
			m_Buffer = new char[m_Size];
			// memcpy (m_Buffer, string, m_Size);
			strcpy (m_Buffer, string);
		}
		~String ()
		{
			delete m_Buffer;
			std::cout << "Delete m_Buffer !" << std::endl;
		}

		const char* GetString () const
		{
			return m_Buffer;
		}

		friend std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& stream, const String& string);

		char& operator [] (unsigned int index)
		{
			return m_Buffer[index];
		}
	private :
		char* m_Buffer;
		unsigned int m_Size;
};

std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& stream, const String& string)
{
	stream << string.m_Buffer;
	return stream;
}

int main ()
{
	String str ("Cherno");
	String str_ = str;
	
	str_[2] = 'a';

	std::cout << str << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

We change the third character of `str_` and print out `str` , then we will find that the output of `str` becomes `Charno` , which means **the changes of** **`str_.m_Buffer`** **contributes to the changes of** **`str.m_Buffer`** .

# 02 Copy Constructor

All the copy operation above is called _**Shallow Copy**_ , which means it just **copies the whole value of the variables** to a new instant but **without diving into some special variables' content**, such as the reference of a pointer.

If we want to copy the instant to another one but assign a new memory block to another instant, we need to use _**Deep Copy**_ . To achieve deep copy, we will use a **copy constructor** .

## 2.1 What is a copy constructor ?

In fact, C++ provides a **default copy constructor** that we have used above, which **performs shallow copy** . If we write the copy constructor explicitly, it will be like :

```C++
class String
{
	public :
		String (const char* string)
		{
			m_Size = strlen (string);
			m_Buffer = new char[m_Size];
			// memcpy (m_Buffer, string, m_Size);
			strcpy (m_Buffer, string);
		}
		~String ()
		{
			delete m_Buffer;
			std::cout << "Delete m_Buffer !" << std::endl;
		}
		// default copy constructor
		String (const String& other)
			: m_Buffer (other.m_Buffer), m_Size (other.m_Size) {}

		const char* GetString () const
		{
			return m_Buffer;
		}

		friend std::ostream& operator << (std::ostream& stream, const String& string);

		char& operator [] (unsigned int index)
		{
			return m_Buffer[index];
		}
	private :
		char* m_Buffer;
		unsigned int m_Size;
};
```

If we don't allow the class to be copied, we can delete the copy constructor :

```C++
String (const String& other) = delete;
```

Then the code `String str_ = str;` will not be allowed to compile.

## 2.2 Write a copy constructor

We can override the copy constructor to achieve the deep copy :

```C++
String (const String& other)
	: m_Size (other.m_Size)
{
	m_Buffer = new char[m_Size];
	strcpy (m_Buffer, other.m_Buffer);
}
```

In this copy constructor, we assign a new memory address on the heap to `m_Buffer`, so then if we print out two instant :

```C++
int main ()
{
	String str ("Cherno");
	String str_ = str;
	
	str_[2] = 'a';

	std::cout << str << std::endl;
	std::cout << str_ << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

The output will be :

```
Cherno
Charno
Delete m_Buffer !
Delete m_Buffer !
```

## 2.3 When will the copy constructor be called ?

Now, we do not want to use `std::cout` to print the instant. Instead, we will write a function to print the instant :

```C++
void PrintString (String str)
{
	std::cout << str << std::endl;
}

int main ()
{
	String str ("Cherno");
	String str_ = str;
	
	str_[2] = 'a';

	PrintString (str);
	PrintString (str_);

	return 0;
}
```

The output of the program is the same as before. But how many times is the copy constructor called ? We now change the copy constructor to :

```C++
String (const String& other)
	: m_Size (other.m_Size)
{
	m_Buffer = new char[m_Size];
	strcpy (m_Buffer, other.m_Buffer);
	std::cout << "Copy Instant !" << std::endl;
}
```

This time, the output of the program will be :

```
Copy Instant !
Copy Instant !
Cherno
Delete m_Buffer !
Copy Instant !
Charno
Delete m_Buffer !
Delete m_Buffer !
Delete m_Buffer !
```

Totally three times copy constructor and four times destructor !

It is because that when we pass a paremeter to a function, we will actually **create the copy of the parameter** and **the copy has a function scope**, which means **when the function is called, the variable is created while the function ends, the variable will be deleted**. So we call the function `PrintString (String str)` twice and copy the instant twice in addition.

## 2.4 How to avoid unnecessary copying ?

To solve this problem, we can simply pass the **reference of the variable** instead of pass the variable directly. Also see [References](../01%20Basic/10.References.md). 

It is better to pass the reference when we won' t modify the variable because it costs less resources.
