# Chapter 6 : Inheritance

**Inheritance** is a important feature of C++ Class. It allows us to **avoid the codes repetation** when we may use some code by many times but some of the methods we want to do a little change.

Assume that we have a basic class `Entity` and we want to create a new class `Player` :

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public : 
		float X, Y;

		void move (float xa, float ya)
		{
			X += xa;
			Y += ya;
		}
};

class Player
{
	public : 
		const char* Name;
		float X, Y;

		void move (float xa, float ya)
		{
			X += xa;
			Y += ya;
		}

		void PrintName ()
		{
			std::cout << Name << std::endl;
		}
};

int main ()
{

	return 0;
}
```

We can see that the class `Player` is very similar to the class `Entity` , so that there are **many codes just be copied and pasted**. But this is actually a new class with new attribute `Name` and new method `PrintName` .

To avoid the code repetition in the program, we can let `Player` inherits `Entity` : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public : 
		float X, Y;

		void move (float xa, float ya)
		{
			X += xa;
			Y += ya;
		}
};

// Inherit the class Entity
class Player : public Entity
{
	public : 
		const char* Name;

		void PrintName ()
		{
			std::cout << Name << std::endl;
		}
};

int main ()
{

	return 0;
}
```

Now the class `Player` has not only its own attribute `Name` and method `PrintName ()` , but also has the attributes `X` , `Y` and method `move ()` ;
