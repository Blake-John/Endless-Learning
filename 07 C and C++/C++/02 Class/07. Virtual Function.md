w# Chapter 7 : Virtual Function

## 7.1 What is a Virtual Function

**Virtual Function** allows us to **override the functions in subclass** . The core of the virtual function is that **the virtual function provides a method to access to the subclass method from the parent class type pointer** .

Assume that we have two class `A` and `B` and `B` is the subclass of `A` , or we can say `B` inherit the class `A` . If we **mark a function to be *virtual* in class `A`** , then we can override the function in `B` so that the function can do another thing or we can leave the function to be original.

Let's see the code below : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public :
		const char* GetName () { return "Entity"; }

};

class Player : public Entity
{
	private :
		const char* m_Name;

	public :
		Player (const char* name) : m_Name (name) {}
		
		const char* GetNamew () { return m_Name; }
};

int main ()
{
	Entity* e = new Entity;
	std::cout << e->GetName () << std::endl;

	Player* p = new Player ("Cherno");
	std::cout << p->GetNamew () << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

This is a good code that if we run it, it will output :

```
Entity
Cherno
```

But if we add a two line : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public :
		const char* GetName () { return "Entity"; }

};

class Player : public Entity
{
	private :
		const char* m_Name;

	public :
		Player (const char* name) : m_Name (name) {}
		
		const char* GetName () { return m_Name; }
};

int main ()
{
	Entity* e = new Entity;
	std::cout << e->GetName () << std::endl;

	Player* p = new Player ("Cherno");
	std::cout << p->GetName () << std::endl;

	Entity* entity = p;
	std::cout << entity->GetName () << std::endl;

	return 0;
}
```

However, if we let `Player` inherit `Entity` , it will lead to an mistake : 

```
Entity
Cherno
Entity
```

Although we define a pointer with type `Entity` , but we **assign the memory address of `Player` to the pointer** , so the pointer is actually point to a class `Player` . But why the third output is `Entity` instead of `Cherno` ?

That is because when compile call the function, it will go into the class and then call that function. The type of `entity` is `Entity` , so the program will call the function `GetNaem ()` from `Entity` instead of `Player` .

To solve this problem, we just need to define the `GetName ()` in `Entity` as a **virtual function** . The virtual function is something about **dynamic dispatch** , which will generate a **v-table** to tell the compile to find the function right.

```C++
class Entity
{
	public :
		virtual const char* GetName () { return "Entity"; }

};
```

In this time, the output will be : 

```
Entity
Cherno
Cherno
```

And another thing we can do is to define the function `GetName ()` in `Palyer` as a **overrided function** . This is optional but there are two advantages :

- The code will be more **readable**
- **Avoid some bug** such as 
	- if we write a wrong function name to be overrided, the clangd could not find any function to be overrided, and we will know there is a bug
	- if we want to override the function in the parent class but the function is not a virtual function, that will lead to error when we add **override** keyword

```C++
class Player : public Entity
{
	private :
		const char* m_Name;

	public :
		Player (const char* name) : m_Name (name) {}
		
		const char* GetName () override { return m_Name; }
};
```

## 7.2 A Pure Virtual Function

### 7.2.1 Definition

A **Pure Virtual Function** allows us to declare a **non-defined function** in a class and **force us to give a definition in the subclass** .

It is common to define a class **with only some declaration** and force the subclass to give the definitions, this is called ***Interface*** . And the interface in the class only contains the non-completed function, which serve as **templates** .

To define a pure virtual function, we just need to throw out the definition in `Entity` , and **set it to be 0** : 

```C++
class Entity
{
	public :
		virtual const char* GetName () = 0;

};
```

By doing this, we can find that we can no longer use `Entity` to create an instant, but the `Player` still work because we has already define that virtual function `GetName ()` .

### 7.2.2 Example

Such as  we want to write a function to **print out the name of the class**, then, we need to **pass the class or the pointer to the class** as a parameter, and **call the method of that class** : 

```C++
void Print (Printable* obj)
{
	std::cout << obj->GetClassName () << std::endl;
}
```

In this case, we can write a `Printable` class to declare a pure virtual function `GetClassName ()` and let other classes inherit it. So that we can have the interface `GetClassName ()` : 

```C++
class Printable
{
	public :
		const char* GetClassName () = 0;
}
```

Then, as is tried above, we can let class `Entity` inherit it and let `Player` inherit `Entity` . By doing so, we **can use the pointer with type  `Printable` to call the method `GetClassName` in *subclass* `Entity` and `Player`** : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Printable
{
	public :
		virtual const char* GetClassName () = 0;
};

class Entity : public Printable
{
	public :
		const char* GetName () { return "Entity"; }
		const char* GetClassName () override { return "Entity"; }

};

class Player : public Entity
{
	private :
		const char* m_Name;

	public :
		Player (const char* name) : m_Name (name) {}
		
		const char* GetName () { return m_Name; }
};

void Print (Printable* obj)
{
	std::cout << obj->GetClassName () << std::endl;
}

int main ()
{
	Entity* e = new Entity;
	// std::cout << e->GetName () << std::endl;
	Print (e);

	Player* p = new Player ("Cherno");
	// std::cout << p->GetName () << std::endl;
	Print (p);

	Entity* entity = p;
	// std::cout << entity->GetName () << std::endl;
	Print (entity);

	return 0;
}
```

The code will run properly and the ouput is :

```
Entity
Entity
Entity
```

This is because class `Entity` has override the pure virtual function `GetClassName ()` but `Player` does not. And `Player` inherits `Entity` so that it inherits the definition of `GetClassName ()` .

If we let `Player` inherit `Printable` and do not give the definition of `GetClassName ()` in the class, the instant `p` could not be created.

Then, we give the definition in `Player` : 

```C++
class Player : public Entity
{
	private :
		const char* m_Name;

	public :
		Player (const char* name) : m_Name (name) {}
		
		const char* GetName () { return m_Name; }
		const char* GetClassName () override { return "Player"; }
};
```

The output will be :

```
Entity
Player
Player
```
