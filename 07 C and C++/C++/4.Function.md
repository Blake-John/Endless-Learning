# What is function
- function is designed to finish some tasks we need
# Why we need function?
- **avoid to repeat copying** the same codes in the program
- more convinient to **change the details** in the same function codes
# How to define a function?
- a basic function is consisting of
	- type
	- function name
	- input parameters
	- codes
	- return value
```C++
	<type> <name> (<variable type> <variable name>,...)
	{
		<codes>
	}
	
	int Multiply (int a, int b)
	{
		return a * b;
	}
```
- but if the function isn't need a return function, we can define the function type as `void`
```C++
	void Multiply (int a, int b)
	{
		cout << a * b << endl;
	}
```

```ad-tip
we can use function to simplify our codes, but we shouldn't take apart our program by each line.
it's no use to every one, because
- it is **hard to read**
- it is **hard to maintain**
- it will make your **program slower**
	- why? see [[]]
```
- and, in real work, we will spilt the function into **declaration** and **definition**, which will be seperately saved in **head file** and **source file**.
