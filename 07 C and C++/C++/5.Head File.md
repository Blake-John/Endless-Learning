# What is Head File?
- **head file** is used to **declare** some functions
- so that the compiler can know the function **exists**
# Why we need Head File?
- if we **define a function in one file** and we want to **use it in another file**, we should let the compiler know the function
- we can **declare** the function in head file, and then we can **include the head file** in another file where we want to use the function
- it is said that we need a **public place to store the declarations**
- and the head file **just contain the declaration**, ==No Definition ! ==
	- it is because a function just **can be defined one time**
- head file can **avoid to write a declaration for each function**
	- it is more convinient to use head file instead of declare every function in every file if we are writing a big project, because a big project is made up of many many files and the files will repeat using the several same functions
