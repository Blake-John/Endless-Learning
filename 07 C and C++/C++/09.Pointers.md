- computer deals with memory
- everything will get stored in memory
- and computer will get the everything of program from memory
# What is Pointers
- Pointers is the **number of the address in memory**
# `void* ptr`
- this is a pure pointer , which **store the address of the memory**
- we can give it a initial value , like `0` or `NULL` or `nullptr`
- but it doesn't mean the address is 0 , it is mean that the pointer is **invalid**
- it is accepted that a pointer is invalid

```ad-question
**How can we get the memory address?**
we can use `&` to get the address of the variable
```

```C++
	void* ptr = &var;
```

```ad-question
#### How can we get the value of the variable if we konw where the data is?
we can use `*` to get the value from the pointer
```

```C++
	std::cout << *ptr << std::endl;
```

```ad-attention
we can use `void* ptr` to store any type of date's address
but we can't use a void pointer to write something into the memory
- it is because the value we write have different meanings in different types
```
# `new`
- this key word will distribute some memory to our pointers
```C++
	char* buffer = new char[8];
	memset (buffer, 0, 8);

	delete[] buffer;
```
- the first line use `new` to get 8 char size memory (8 byte)
- `memset` will initialize the value in the memory
- `delete` is used to delete the pointer and release the memory
	- `delete[]` means the subject of this function is an array

```ad-attention
- the pointer **point to the ==beginning== of the data**
	- so if we `std::cout << *buffer << std::endl;` , we will **only get one value (the first value)** from the array

- and although the `buffer` is a pointer, when we `std::cout << buffer;`, the compiler will **automatically ==print the content== in the memory of this address**
	- because it points to an array, this is something special
	- the compiler will consider it as a **string**
		- more exactly, the compiler will consider the type `char* <variable>` as a string

- another thing is that , because the system will **automatically add `'\0'` to the end of the a string**, so if we `std::cout << buffer;`, the compiler will print the array **from the first element** and **==keep output== the value in the next address of the memory ==until the compiler encounters the content of `'\0'`==**  
	- so this is why we output the `char* buffer` type data will get some other characters -> the end of the array has no `'\0'`
	- but the type `const char* <variable>` won't have this problem because it is a **const pointer**, it's value will not be changed, so the compiler won't keep output. It will just output all the contents in the memory
```
