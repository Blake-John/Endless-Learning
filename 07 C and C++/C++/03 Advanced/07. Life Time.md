Every time we enter a **scope** , we **push a stack frame** .

# 01 Scope

The scope is **some special structure in code** , such as `if` statement scope, function scope, or a class scope.

Let's see an example : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{ // scope of a class
	public :
		Entity ()
		{
			std::cout << "Created Entity !" << std::endl;
		}
		~Entity ()
		{
			std::cout << "Destroyed Entity !" << std::endl;
		}
	private :
		int x;
}; // end of a class scope

int main ()
{
	{
		Entity e;
	}

	return 0;
}
```

If we debug the code and set break point at line `Entity e;` , and we step forward this line, we will find that the screen outputs `Created Entity !` . Then, if we step over the end of the scope `}` , we will find that the screen outputs `Destroyed Entity !` . It means that the variable `e` is only alive in that `{}` scope, and **when the scope ends, the stack of that scope is thrown out and the memory now is free** .

But if we create the instant `e` on the heap : 

```C++
int main ()
{
	{
		Entity* e = new Entity ();
	}

	return 0;
}
```

Even though the program is run out of that scope, the instant `e` is still alive and will not be destroyed until the whole program is to the end.

# 02 Create Objects

If we want to create an array in a function, we may write : 

```C++
int* CreateArray ()
{
	int array[50];
	return array;
}
```

The code above seems to be right but totally wrong. It will lead to a warning `Address of stack memory associated with local variable 'array' returned` .

That is because when the function runs to the end, the memory of that stack will be clear. We **return a pointer to that memory being cleared,** so that the returned pointer is useless. If we want to make it sensible, we can create that array in heap and return the pointer to that memory : 

```C++
int* CreateArray ()
{
	int* array = new int[50];
	return array;
}
```

If we want to create an object on the heap, but after the scope the object will be deleted, how to do it ?

- we can use the class such as `smart_ptr` or `unique_ptr` 
- but we can also write a class to achieve that

```C++
#include <iostream>

class Entity
{
	public :
		Entity ()
		{
			std::cout << "Created Entity !" << std::endl;
		}
		~Entity ()
		{
			std::cout << "Destroyed Entity !" << std::endl;
		}
	private :
		int x;
};

class ScopePtr
{
	public :
		ScopePtr (Entity* e)
			: m_Ptr (e) {}
		~ScopePtr ()
		{
			delete m_Ptr;
		}
	private :
		Entity* m_Ptr;
};


int main ()
{
	{
		ScopePtr e = new Entity ();
		ScopePtr e1 (new Entity ());
	}


	return 0;
}
```

In the code above, we create a class `ScopePtr` , and then use the class to create instants `e` , `e1` . The way to create `e` and `e1` is slightly different, such as : 

- `ScopePtr e = new Entity ();` use the [implicit conversion](../02%20Class/10.%20Implicit%20and%20Explicit.md#10.1%20Implicit%20Conversion) 
- `ScopePtr e1 (new Entity ());` is the normal code

**Why will the instant on heap be deleted at the end of the scope ?** 

It is because that, we **create an instant of `ScopePtr` on the stack** . At the end of the scope, **the instant `e` will be destroyed and will call the destructor to perform the delete function** .
