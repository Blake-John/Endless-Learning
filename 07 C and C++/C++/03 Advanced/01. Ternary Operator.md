A **ternary operator** is basically the **syntactic surger** for `if` statement. If we don not want to deal with `if` statement, we can use it.

# 01 Single Ternary Operator

Let's see the code to set the `s_Speed` determine by the `s_Level` : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

static int s_Level = 1;
static int s_Speed = 2;

int main ()
{
	if (s_Level > 5)
	{
		s_Speed = 10;
	}
	else
	{
		s_Speed = 5;
	}

	return 0;
}
```

This is a simple programe but we can simplify it by the ternary operator : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

static int s_Level = 1;
static int s_Speed = 2;

int main ()
{
	// use the ternary operator
	s_Speed = s_Level > 5 ? 10 : 5;
	return 0;
}
```

Let's see another example. If we need to declare a new variable `rank` , and assign the value determined by `s_Level` , we can use `if` statement : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

static int s_Level = 1;
static int s_Speed = 2;

int main ()
{
	std::string rank;
	if (s_Level > 5)
	{
		rank = "Master";
	}
	else
	{
		rank = "Beginner";
	}
	return 0;
}
```

Use the ternary operator : 

```C++
#include <iostream>

static int s_Level = 1;
static int s_Speed = 2;

int main ()
{
	std::string rank = s_Level > 5 ? "Master" : "Beginner";
	return 0;
}
```

The second block of code is **more simplified and runs more fast**. It is because that, when we use `if` statement, we first **create an empty variable `name`** and then **create another string `"Master"` or `"Beginner"`** and then **override the that variable former,** but when we use the ternary operator, we **do not create additional variables**. So the second code runs more fast.

# 02 Multiple Tarnary Operator

```C++
#include <iostream>

static int s_Level = 1;
static int s_Speed = 2;

int main ()
{
	// use multiple ternary operator
	s_Speed = s_Level > 5 ? s_Level > 10 ? 15 : 10 : 5;
	return 0;
}
```

It is better to let the code be pure and it is better not to use the multiple ternary operator.
