# 01 Static in the normal code
## 1.1 Static

- a static variable is said that the variable is **only visable in the translation section** ^ce184e
- assume that we have such a file structure

```
chapter4
	|__ Static.cpp
	|__ Main.cpp
```

- in the `Static.cpp` , we have

```Cpp
static int s_variable = 5;
```

- in the `Main.cpp` , we have

```Cpp
#include <iostream>

int main ()
{
	s_variable = 10;
	std::cout << s_variable << std::endl;
}
```

- the output will be `10`
- but if in the `Static.cpp` , we have

```Cpp
int s_varible = 5;
```
- we will get a **linking error**
	- because we can't define a variable twice
	![](07%20C%20and%20C++/C++/imgs/13.ClassImgs/屏幕截图%202023-11-25%20114922.png)

```ad-tip
so, by here, you can easily understand 

![](#^ce184e) 

means the variable with `static` attribute can only be visable int the minimal translation section, the other file could not access the variable
```

## 1.2 Extern

- if we wants to find a variable outside this translation, we can define a same name variable by `extern`
	- which called **external linking**
- in `Main.cpp`

```Cpp
#include <iostream>

extern int variable;

int main ()
{
	std::cout << variable << std::endl;
}
```

- in `Static.cpp`

```Cpp
int variable = 10;
```

- the output will be `10` 

```ad-attention
1. **We can't have two global variable with same name**
2. if we define a variable as `static` , we can't find the variable at other translation units , **although there is an `extern` before the variable**

- in `Static.cpp`

	```Cpp
	static int variable = 5;
	```
	
- in `Main.cpp`

	```Cpp
	#include <iostream>

	extern int variable;

	int main ()
	{
		std::cout << variable << std::endl;
	}
	```

- this will lead to a linking error
	- because the compiler could not find a external symbol `int variable`
```

```ad-seealso
- the keyword `static` is **not only can affect the variable, but also the functions**
	- if we set the functin to be `static` , it can not be found in other translation units
- but the `extern` could not act on the function , because if we want to use an external function , we will include that file
```

# 02 Static inside Class/Struct
- the static variable inside the class means no matter how many instances you create, there is only one variable in the memory
## Not to use `static`

- Let's see some codes

```Cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Entity
{
	int x, y;

	void Print ()
	{
		std::cout << x << ", " << y << std::endl;
	}
};

int main ()
{
	Entity e;
	e.x = 2;
	e.y = 3;

	Entity e1 = {5, 8};

	e.Print ();
	e1.Print ();

	return 0;
}
```

- the output will be

```
2, 3
5, 8
```

## use `static`

- if we use static to define the variable `x` and `y` ,such as

```Cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Entity
{
	static int x, y;

	void Print ()
	{
		std::cout << x << ", " << y << std::endl;
	}
};

int main ()
{
	Entity e;
	e.x = 2;
	e.y = 3;

	Entity e1 = {5, 8};

	e.Print ();
	e1.Print ();

	return 0;
}
```

- this will lead to an error, which tell us there is too many initial value of `x` and `y`
	- it is because by writing `Entity e1 = {5, 8};` , we are going to initialize the variable in the struct, but actually we can't write this
- if we replace `Entity e1 = {5, 8};` with `Entity e1;` , there will come to the second problem
	- `unresolved external symbol`
	- which tell us that we can't find the definition of `x` and `y`
	- that is, the **static variable must be initialized**
- so we can write this

```Cpp
struct Entity
{
	static int x, y;

	void Print ()
	{
		std::cout << x << ", " << y << std::endl;
	}
};

int Entity::x;
int Entity::y;

int main ()
{
	Entity e;
	e.x = 2;
	e.y = 3;

	Entity e1;
	e1.x = 5;
	e1.y = 8;

	e.Print ();
	e1.Print ();
	

	return 0;
}
```

```ad-attention
- we can't give it a initial value in the struct, like
	
	```Cpp
	struct Entity
	{
		static int x = 0, y = 0;
	};
	```
	
- maybe it is because if we do so, we **will initialize the value each time we create a new date using type `Entity`**.
- but the **static variable must have a constant initial value**
```

- the output of the program will be

```
5, 8
5, 8
```

```ad-summary
#### Why the output is that ?
1. it is because the static variable in the struct **have only one instance**
2. no matter how many object we create, there will only one instance of `x` and `y`
3. so actually, when we write `e1.x` and `e.x` , we are going to **access the same variable, which means we are getting the value from the same memeory address**
```

- so instead of write `e1.x` to access the variable `x` , it is more clear to write `Entity::x`
	- which is like to create `x` and `y` in the namespace called `Entity`

```ad-seealso
- the s**tatic methods** in struct or class is **the same as variables**
```

```ad-attention
- **the static method could not access a variable which is not static**
```

- Let's see the codes

```Cpp
struct Entity
{
	int x, y;

	static void Print()
	{
		std::cout << x << ", " << y << std::endl;
	}
};


int main()
{
	Entity e;
	Entity e1;

	e.x = 2;
	e.y = 3;

	e1.x = 5;
	e1.y = 8;


	e.Print();
	e1.Print();


	return 0;
}
```

- this will lead to an error
	- `illegal reference to non-static member 'Entity::x'`
	- the reason is 
		- the **static method have no a class instance**
		- but the **non-static variable is associated with an class instance**
	- so it is **the same as we write a function outside the class and try to access the variable inside the class**

```ad-tip
every nonstatic method always **get an instance of this class to be the arguement**
```

- so the code above is actually like this in the compiler :

```Cpp
struct Entity
{
	int x, y;

};
static void Print()
{
	std::cout << x << ", " << y << std::endl;
}
```

# 03 Local Static

- a variable set to static **in a function/class** , this variable is **just visible to that function/class** , you can't access the variable outside the function or the class  

```Cpp
class Singleton
{
public :
	static Singleton& Get()
	{
		static Singleton instance;
		return instance;
	}

	void hello()
	{
		std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;
	}
};


int main()
{
	Singleton::Get ().hello ();

	return 0;
}
```
