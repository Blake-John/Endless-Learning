`auto` is a keyword that can automatically **infer the variable types** .

```C++
#include <iostream>

int main ()
{
    int a = 2;
    auto b = a;
    return 0;
}
```

The compiler will automatically set the type of the variables.

# When to use `auto`

**It is better not to use** **`auto`** **in most common situations** . That is because use `auto` casually will lead to the decline in readability of the code.

But there are still some situations where we can use `auto` :

- If the function returns multiple types, we can use `auto` as the returned type
- If the type of a variable is toooooo long, such as some container or iterator, we can use `auto` to simplify the code
