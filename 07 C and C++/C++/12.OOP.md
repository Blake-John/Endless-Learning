# What is Object Oriented Programming?
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a software development approach that focuses on **defining** and **sculpting** named classes as **entities** with **attributes** and **behaviours**.
- Object Oriented Programming relies on the concept of **classes** and **objects**.
- It makes **reusing** and **maintaining** code easier, because **it structures a software program into simple, reusable pieces of classes, which are used to create indicidual instances of objects**.
## Some Principles of OOP
1. **Encapsulation** : advances the benefits of **modularity and hiding away of complexities** in better maintain and reason about the code.
2. **Inheritance** : allows for one class (child class) to **inherit** the **fields/attributes and methods** from other class (parent class).
3. **Polymorphism** : promotes dynamic inheritance of child class from their parent class, in order to **make use of these features themselves in code**.
4. **Abstraction** : highlights the benefit of hiding complex parts of code so as to make it easier to reason and make decisions about code.
