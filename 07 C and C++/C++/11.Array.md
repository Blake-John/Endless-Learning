# What is Array ?
- an array is a **collection of elements**
- the elements in an array is **with the same type**

# Why we need Array ?
- sometimes we want to **store a range of datas** , but it is **terrible to declare so many datas seperately**
- and it is completely **impossible to maintain** that range of datas
	- such as you need to write 50 lines of codes to set 50 variables to a initial value
# How to define an array ?
```C++
	<type> <array_name>[<number of elements>];

	int example[5]; // we declare an array named `example` , whose type is int
	// it is said that the array contain 5 intergers
```
- when we define an array , the computer will distribute **enough memory space** to store the elements in the array

## Initialize the array

we can initialize the array at it was defined by following method :

```C++
	int arry[6] = {1, 2, 3, 40};
	// the first four elements of this arry will be initialize by the given value, and the rest of the elements will be set to 0

	int arrys[5] = {0};
	// the each element of the array will be set to 0
```

# How to access the array ?
```C++
	<array_name>[<index>]
	// the index in C++ is start with 0

	example[3] = 3;
	// we set the fourth element as a integer `3`

	std::cout << <array_name>[<index] << std::endl;
	// by do this , we can print the value of that element in the array
	
	std::cout << example[3]; << std::endl;
```
- `index` is actually **which** element/variable at that array I **refer to**
- `index` is begin with `0`
	- in C++ / C and Python , the `index` all begin with `0`
	- but in some language like Lua , the `index` is start with `1`
- by writing this code , we can **access the element** in the array , which means we can **get the value stored in the memory**
```ad-tip
it is said that accessing the array by index is to get the exact value of this type of data
```C++
	example[0] = 0;
	int a = example[0];
```

```C++
	std::cout << <array_name> << std::endl;
	// but doing this , we will get the memory address of the array
```
```ad-attention
- if you **print the array name** , you will actually **get the memory address** of this array
#### Why ?
- it is because the array name `<array_name>` such as `example` is actually ==**a pointer type**==
```

# Memory Access Violation
- this means that I access the memory **does not belong to me(that array)**
	- in debug mode , you will get an error message helping you debug the code
	- in release mode , you won't get an error message , because you **just write something into the memory** , which is **permitted**
		- but actually , you will change the value in other memory 
```ad-attention
#### Why is memory access violation serious ? 
- in the code , you just write something into the memory doesn't belong to you(that array)
- but this part of memory is probably a part of another variable's memory in the source code
- so when you access the memory outside this array , you may change other important variable without realizing it
```

# Array with For Loop
- we can use for loop to iterate the every element in the array by using a index
```C++
	int example[5];

	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
		example[i] = 0;
	}

	// we can initialize the array setting every element to `0`
```

# Array in Memory
- the elements of the array in the memory is **stored continuously**
- it is said that they are set in a row
```ad-tip
if we have an array :
	```C++
	int example[5];
	example[0] = 2;
	example[4] = 4;
	```

![](Pasted%20image%2020231113121805.png)
- the `example` is an `int` type array containing 5 int variable
- and every int variable **takes up 4 byte memory**
- so ther will be **20 byte** memory belongs to the array

```

- and we have said that the `example` is just a **pointer**
- if we `std::cout << example;` , we will get `0x000000EC6FFAFA48`
- so we can create a pointer to **save the address** , such as
```C++
	int* ptr = example;
```

- then , we can use the new pointer to **access the array**
```C++
	std::cout << ptr << std:endl; 
	// this will print the address of array `example`

	std::cout << *(ptr + 2) << std::endl;
	// this will print the third element of the array `element`
```

- Let's see a program : 
```C++
	int example[5];
	
	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
		example[i] = 0;
	}
	// now the every element in the array is 0
	
	example[0] = 2;
	example[1] = 3;
	example[4] = 4;
```
- now , the array in the memory is :
![](Pasted%20image%2020231113124140.png)
```C++
	int* ptr = example;
	*ptr = 3;
```
- now , it turns to :
![](Pasted%20image%2020231113124247.png)
```C++
	*(ptr + 2) = 5;
	// the address plusing the offset is used to access the elemnt , which is the same as by using index

	//we can write
	example[2] = 5;
```
- here , the third element is set to `5` :
![](Pasted%20image%2020231113124344.png)
```C++
	*(int*)((char *)ptr + 8) = 6;
```
- but here , the third element is reset to `6` :
![](Pasted%20image%2020231113124429.png)
```ad-tip
#### What the code above means ?
1. we use `(char*)` to change the pointer to a `char` type
2. we plus the pointer with an **offset 8**
3. we use `(int*)` to rechange the pointer to an `int` type
4. we use `*` to **derefer** the pointer to get the value in the memory

#### Why the Offset is `8` ?
1. the `example` array has a `int` type , and **an `int` type data takes up 4 byte memory**
2. we use `ptr + 2` to access **the address of the third element**
	- the `int` type pointer will automatically **transform the offset to ==the size of memory==**
	- so `ptr + 2` will lead to get the memory ==after the start memory  `2 * 4` byte==
	- this means the offset is `8 / 4 == 2`
1. but we change the pointer to a `char` type , and **a `char` type data takes up 1 byte memory**
2. we need to get the memory of the third element , which is `2 * 4` byte after the start memory
	- so the offset is `8 / 1 == 8`
```

```ad-summary
so , by now , we can have a deeper realization of an array
1. an array is a **collection of some datas with the ==same type==**
2. the elements in the array are **stored continuously** in the memory
	- it is said that the elements are stored in a row one by one
3. the name of array `<array_name>` is just a **pointer** , which **points to the first element** in the array
	- it is said that **the value of the pointer is ==the memory address of the first element in the array==**
4. we can use **index** or **derefer the address of the array with the ==offset==** to access to the element
```

# How to get the elements number?
- actually, the array doesn't not contain the number
- but if you have the size of the array and the data type of the array, we can easily calculate the number of element
```C++
	int a[5];
	int count = sizeof (a) / sizeof (int);
	// the total size of the array divided by the size of data type will yield the number of elements
```
- but if you distribute some memory space to a pointer, the size of this pointer will just the size of a normal pointer
- also, if you have this array as a parameter in the function, the size of this parameter is just its size of a normal pointer

# a special type of data : Array
- in C++11 and newer, there is a special type of data `array`
- we can use this type of data to create an array
```C++
	#include <array>

	array <int, 5> example;
	// we create an array, whose type is int and whose size is 20, which means it contains 5 int
```
- by use this type of data, we can easily access to the size of the array
```C++
	std::cout << example.size () << std::endl;
```
