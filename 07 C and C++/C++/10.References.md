- reference is just the extension of pointer
- the function of the reference is the same as the pointer, but it makes the codes simpler
# How to create a reference ?
```C++
	int a = 5;
	int& ref = a;
	// a = 5, ref = 5;

	ref++;
	// a = 6, ref = 6;
```
- the code is the same as : 
```C++
	int a = 5;
	int* ptr = &a;
	// a = 5, *ptr = 5

	(*ptr)++;
	// a = 6, *ptr = 6
```
