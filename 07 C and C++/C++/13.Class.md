# Chapter 1 : A Brief Introduction of Class
## 1.1 What is Class  ?
- In brief, class is a method to **group datas and functionalities together**
## 1.2 Why we need Class ?
- In the game programming, we need a character with some attributes.
- If we write the code by the method of procedure oriented, it will be
```C++
	int main ()
	{
		// we are going to write some attributes of the character
		// such as its position and moving speed
		int x, y;
		int speed;
	}
```
- the code above seems not to be so strange, but the variable has no exact meaning, so we may
```C++
	int main ()
	{
		// we are going to write some attributes of the character
		// such as its position and moving speed
		int PlayerX, PlayerY;
		int PlayerSpeed;
	}
```
- it looks great !
- but if we are going to add another character, we need to do so
```C++
	int main ()
	{
		// we are going to add another character
		int Player1X, Player1Y;
		int Player2X, Player2Y;
		int Player1Speed;
		int Player2Speed;
	}
```
- it is going to be somewhat confusion, what if we add the third character ?
> In order to promote the reusing of code and make it easier to maintain, we need the method of [[12.OOP|OOP]] , in which, the concept of class is important

## 1.3 How to use a Class ?
### 1.3.1 create a class
```C++
	class <name>
	{
		<codes>
	};
```
```ad-tip
- the **name of the class must be the only one** 
- Comparision with the function, **there must be a `;` after the definition of a class**
```
- so we can write the code above like : 
```C++
	class Player
	{
		int x, y;
		int speed;
	};
```
- by now, we have successfully create a data type named `Player`
### 1.3.2 use the class
- since the **class is just a new type of data** , we can use it to create an **object** like we defining other type of variables
```C++
	Player player;
```
- variables made from class type are called **objects** , and new object variable is called **instance**
### 1.3.3 edit the object
#### 01 Access the variables in the class
- if now we going to `main` function, and write
```C++
	int main ()
	{
		player.x = 5;
	}
```
- it will get an error
	- `cannot access private member declared in class "Player"`
- it is because by default, the every member in a class is **private**
	- which means only the **function inde that class can access these members**
- so we can set these variables be `public`
```C++
	class Player
	{
		public :
			int x, y;
			int speed;
	};

	int main ()
	{
		Player player;
		player.x = 5;
	}
```

#### 02 The function in the class
- we wants to write a function to control the character to move (change the position variables) , we can
```C++
	void Move (Player &player, int dx, int dy)
	{
		player.x += dx * player.speed;
		player.y += dy * player.speed;
	}

	int main ()
	{
		Move (player, 5, 5);
	}
```
- but exactly, we can move the `Move` function into the class, because a class can contain some function
	- function inside the class is called **method**
```C++
	class Player
	{
		public :
			int x, y;
			int speed;
	
			void Move (int dx, int dy)
			{
				x += dx * speed;
				y += dy * speed;
			}
	};

	int main ()
	{
		player.Move (1, -1);
	}
```

# Chapter 2 : The Difference between Class and Structure
- the member in **class** is **private by default**
- but the member in **struct** is **public by default**
## Why the `struct` still exist in C++ ?
- because the C++ need to **be compatible with the old standard and C**
	- we can use `struct` to group some datas, just the collection of datas
	- we can use `class` to create a object with many complex attributes and methods
# Chapter 3 : How to write a class ?
> in this chapter, we are going to write a class `Log` to log out the informations

```C++
	#include <iostream>

	class Log
	{
	public :
		const int LogLevelError = 0;
		const int LogLevelWarning = 1;
		const int LogLevelInfo = 2;
	
	public:
		void SetLevel(int level)
		{
			m_LogLevel = level;
		}
	
		void Warn(const char* message)
		{
			if (m_LogLevel >= LogLevelWarning)
			{
				std::cout << "[Warn] : " << message << std::endl;
			}
		}
	
		void Error(const char* message)
		{
			if (m_LogLevel >= LogLevelError)
			{
				std::cout << "[Error] : " << message << std::endl;
			}
		}
	
		void Info(const char* message)
		{
			if (m_LogLevel >= LogLevelInfo)
			{
				std::cout << "[Informations] : " << message << std::endl;
			}
		}
	
	private:
		int m_LogLevel = LogLevelInfo;
	};
	
	
	int main()
	{
		Log log;
		log.SetLevel(log.LogLevelError);
		log.Warn("Hello!");
		log.Info("Hello!");
		log.Error("Hello!");
	
		std::cin.get();
		return 0;
	}
```

# Chapter 4 : Static
## 4.1 Static in the normal code
### 4.1.1 Static
- a static variable is said that the variable is only visable in the translation section ^ce184e
- assume that we have such a file structure
```
	chapter4
		|__ Static.cpp
		|__ Main.cpp
```
- in the `Static.cpp` , we have
```C++
	static int s_variable = 5;
```
- in the `Main.cpp` , we have
```C++
	#include <iostream>

	int main ()
	{
		s_variable = 10;
		std::cout << s_variable << std::endl;
	}
```
- the output will be `10`
- but if in the `Static.cpp` , we have
```C++
	int s_varible = 5;
```
- we will get a **linking error**
	- because we can't define a variable twice
![[屏幕截图 2023-11-25 114922.png]]
```ad-tip
so, by here, you can easily understand ![[13.Class#^ce184e]] means
the variable with `static` attribute can only be visable int the minimal translation section, the other file could not access the variable
```

### 4.1.2 Extern
- if we wants to find a variable outside this translation, we can define a same name variable by `extern`
	- which called **external linking**
- in `Main.cpp`
```C++
	#include <iostream>
	
	extern int variable;

	int main ()
	{
		std::cout << variable << std::endl;
	}
```
- in `Static.cpp`
```C++
	int variable = 10;
```
- the output will be `10` 
```ad-attention
1. **We can't have two global variable with same name**
2. if we define a variable as `static` , we can't find the variable at other translation units , **although there is an `extern` before the variable**

- in `Static.cpp`
	```C++
		static int variable = 5;
	```
- in `Main.cpp`
	```C++
		#include <iostream>
	
		extern int variable;
	
		int main ()
		{
			std::cout << variable << std::endl;
		}
	```

- this will lead to a linking error
	- because the compiler could not find a external symbol `int variable`
```

```ad-seealso
- the keyword `static` is **not only can affect the variable, but also the functions**
	- if we set the functin to be `static` , it can not be found in other translation units
- but the `extern` could not act on the function , because if we want to use an external function , we will include that file
```

## 4.2 Static inside Class
- the static variable inside the class means no matter how many instances you create, there is only one variable in the memory
### Not to use `static`
- Let's see some codes
```C++
	#include <iostream>
	
	struct Entity
	{
		int x, y;
	
		void Print ()
		{
			std::cout << x << ", " << y << std::endl;
		}
	};
	
	int main ()
	{
		Entity e;
		e.x = 2;
		e.y = 3;
	
		Entity e1 = {5, 8};
	
		e.Print ();
		e1.Print ();

		return 0;
	}
```
- the output will be
```
2, 3
5, 8
```
### use `static`
- if we use static to define the variable `x` and `y` ,such as
```C++
	#include <iostream>
	
	struct Entity
	{
		static int x, y;
	
		void Print ()
		{
			std::cout << x << ", " << y << std::endl;
		}
	};
	
	int main ()
	{
		Entity e;
		e.x = 2;
		e.y = 3;
	
		Entity e1 = {5, 8};
	
		e.Print ();
		e1.Print ();

		return 0;
	}
```
- this will lead to an error, which tell us there is too many initial value of `x` and `y`
	- it is because by writing `Entity e1 = {5, 8};` , we are going to initialize the variable in the struct, but actually we can't write this
- if we replace `Entity e1 = {5, 8};` with `Entity e1;` , there will come to the second problem
	- `unresolved external symbol`
	- which tell us that we can't find the definition of `x` and `y`
	- that is, the **static variable must be initialized**
- so we can write this
```C++
	struct Entity
	{
		static int x, y;
	
		void Print ()
		{
			std::cout << x << ", " << y << std::endl;
		}
	};
	
	int Entity::x;
	int Entity::y;
	
	int main ()
	{
		Entity e;
		e.x = 2;
		e.y = 3;
	
		Entity e1;
		e1.x = 5;
		e1.y = 8;
	
		e.Print ();
		e1.Print ();
		
	
		return 0;
	}
```
```ad-attention
- we can't give it a initial value in the struct, like
	```C++
		struct Entity
		{
			static int x = 0, y = 0;
		};
	```
- maybe it is because if we do so, we **will initialize the value each time we create a new date using type `Entity`**.
- but the **static variable must have a constant initial value**
```
- the output of the program will be
```
5, 8
5, 8
```

```ad-summary
#### Why the output is that ?
1. it is because the static variable in the struct **have only one instance**
2. no matter how many object we create, there will only one instance of `x` and `y`
3. so actually, when we write `e1.x` and `e.x` , we are going to **access the same variable, which means we are getting the value from the same memeory address**
```
- so instead of write `e1.x` to access the variable `x` , it is more clear to write `Entity::x`
	- which is like to create `x` and `y` in the namespace called `Entity`
```ad-seealso
- the s**tatic methods** in struct or class is **the same as variables**
```
```ad-attention
- **the static method could not access a variable which is not static**
```
- Let's see the codes
```C++
	struct Entity
	{
		int x, y;
	
		static void Print()
		{
			std::cout << x << ", " << y << std::endl;
		}
	};
	
	
	int main()
	{
		Entity e;
		Entity e1;
	
		e.x = 2;
		e.y = 3;
	
		e1.x = 5;
		e1.y = 8;
	
	
		e.Print();
		e1.Print();
	
	
		return 0;
	}
```
- this will lead to an error
	- `illegal reference to non-static member 'Entity::x'`
	- the reason is 
		- the **static method have no a class instance**
		- but the **non-static variable is associated with an class instance**
	- so it is **the same as we write a function outside the class and try to access the variable inside the class**
```ad-tip
every nonstatic method always **get an instance of this class to be the arguement**
```
- so the code above is actually like this in the compiler :
```C++
	struct Entity
	{
		int x, y;
	
	};
	static void Print()
	{
		std::cout << x << ", " << y << std::endl;
	}
```

## 4.3 Local Static
- a variable set to static **in a function/class** , this variable is **just visible to that function/class** , you can't access the variable outside the function or the class  
```C++
	class Singleton
	{
	public :
		static Singleton& Get()
		{
			static Singleton instance;
			return instance;
		}
	
		void hello()
		{
			std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;
		}
	};
	
	
	int main()
	{
		Singleton::Get ().hello ();
	
		return 0;
	}
```

# Chapter 5 : Enumeration
- an enumeration is a group of some data
- any variable created by this type only has the value in the enumeration type, such as
```C++
	#include <iostream>

	enum Example
	{
		A, B, C
	};
	
	int a = 0;
	int b = 1;
	int c = 2;
	
	int main()
	{
		Example value = 5;
	
		if (value == B)
		{
	
		}
	
		return 0;
	}
```
- the sentence `Example value = 5;` will ==lead to an error==
	- because the **`Example` type of variable only has the value `A` `B` `C`** , you can't initialize the variable by other value.
- and the value of the `A` `B` `C` is by default `0` `1` `2`
- but you can set them to any value you want, and they will increasing one by one
- also, you can set the date type in the enumeration, such as
```C++
	enum Example : unsigned char
	{
		A, B, C
	};
	
	int a = 0;
	int b = 1;
	int c = 2;
	
	int main()
	{
		Example value = B;
	
		if (value == 1)
		{
			std::cout << value << std::endl;
		}
	
		return 0;
	}
```
```ad-attention
- the value/data type in a enumeration must be the type of `int` or type **related to `int`**
- such as
	- `int`
	- `unsigned int`
	- `unsigned char`
- not
	- `float`
	- `double`
```

- Let's jump back to the log class
```C++
	class Log
	{
	public:
		enum LogLevel
		{
			LevelError = 0, LevelWarning, LevelInfo
		};
	
	public:
		void SetLevel(LogLevel level)
		{
			m_LogLevel = level;
		}
	
		void Warn(const char* message)
		{
			if (m_LogLevel >= LevelWarning)
			{
				std::cout << "[Warn] : " << message << std::endl;
			}
		}
	
		void Error(const char* message)
		{
			if (m_LogLevel >= LevelError)
			{
				std::cout << "[Error] : " << message << std::endl;
			}
		}
	
		void Info(const char* message)
		{
			if (m_LogLevel >= LevelInfo)
			{
				std::cout << "[Informations] : " << message << std::endl;
			}
		}
	
	private:
		int m_LogLevel = LevelInfo;
	};
	
	
	int main()
	{
		Log log;
		log.SetLevel(Log::LevelError);
		log.Warn("Hello!");
		log.Info("Hello!");
		log.Error("Hello!");
	
		std::cin.get();
		return 0;
	}
```


# Chapter 6 : Constructor
## 6.1 How to create a constructor
- `constructor` is a special method which will **run every time we create an object**
- Let's see an example :
```C++
	#include <iostream>

	class Entity
	{
	public :
		float X, Y;
	
		void Print()
		{
			std::cout << X << '\t' << Y << std::endl;
		}
	};
	
	int main()
	{
		Entity e;
		std::cout << e.X << std::endl;
	
		return 0;
	}
```
- if we want to print the `X` , it will lead to an error
	- which tell us that the `X` is an uninitialized local variable
- so we need some method to initialize the instance when it was created
```ad-attention
- the `constructor` will only be called when we create an instance
- so if we just use the static method, it won't run
```
## 6.2 How to hide the constructor
- if I just want to Let someone else to use the static method, and don't create an instance, we can hide the constructor
- that is, we can set the constructor to be invisible outside the class
	- because when ever we want to create an instance, it will run the constructor
	- so if it couldn't run the constructor, we couldn't create an instance
- To achieve this, we can **set the constructor to the private**
```C++
	class Entity
	{
		public :
			static void Log ()
			{
			}

		private :
			Entity ()
			{
			}
	};

	int main ()
	{
		Entity l; // this will lead to an error
	
		return 0;
	}
```
- or we can simply **delete the constructor**
```C++
	class Entity
	{
		public :
			static void Log ()
			{
			}

			Entity () = delete;
	};

	int main ()
	{
		Entity l; // this will lead to an error
	
		return 0;
	}
```
